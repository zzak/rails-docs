<p>After loading the framework and any gems in your application, Rails turns to
loading initializers. An initializer is any Ruby file stored under
<code>config/initializers</code> in your application. You can use initializers to hold
configuration settings that should be made after all of the frameworks and gems
are loaded, such as options to configure settings for these parts.</p>

<p>The files in <code>config/initializers</code> (and any subdirectories of
<code>config/initializers</code>) are sorted and loaded one by one as part of
the <code>load_config_initializers</code> initializer.</p>

<p>If an initializer has code that relies on code in another initializer, you can
combine them into a single initializer instead. This makes the dependencies more
explicit, and can help surface new concepts within your application. Rails also
supports numbering of initializer file names, but this can lead to file name
churn. Explicitly loading initializers with <code>require</code> is not recommended, since
it will cause the initializer to get loaded twice.</p>

<div class="note"><p>There is no guarantee that your initializers will run after all the gem
initializers, so any initialization code that depends on a given gem having been
initialized should go into a <code>config.after_initialize</code> block.</p></div>
