<p>It's helpful to be able to test incoming emails in development without actually
sending and receiving real emails. To accomplish this, there's a conductor
controller mounted at <code>/rails/conductor/action_mailbox/inbound_emails</code>,
which gives you an index of all the InboundEmails in the system, their
state of processing, and a form to create a new InboundEmail as well.</p>
