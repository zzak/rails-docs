<p>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language.
It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions
about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less
code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks.
Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application
development more fun.</p>

<p>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a "best"
way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to
discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a
tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from
other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you
learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</p>

<p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Don't Repeat Yourself:</strong> DRY is a principle of software development which
states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
representation within a system". By not writing the same information over and over
again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Convention Over Configuration:</strong> Rails has opinions about the best way to do many
things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than
require that you specify minutiae through endless configuration files.</li>
</ul>
