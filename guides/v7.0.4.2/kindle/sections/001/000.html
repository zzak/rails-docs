<p>This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with creating a Rails
application from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience
with Rails.</p>

<p>Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language.
If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning
curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources
for learning Ruby:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/">Official Ruby Programming Language website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books-langs.md#ruby">List of Free Programming Books</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover older versions of
Ruby, and may not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day
development with Rails.</p>
