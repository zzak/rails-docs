<p>For each controller, there is an associated directory in the <code>app/views</code> directory which holds the template files that make up the views associated with that controller. These files are used to display the view that results from each controller action.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at what Rails does by default when creating a new resource using the scaffold generator:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">bin/rails </span>generate scaffold article
<span class="go">      [...]
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/articles
      create      app/views/articles/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/articles/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/articles/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/articles/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
      [...]
</span></code></pre>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-text="bin/rails generate scaffold article
">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>There is a naming convention for views in Rails. Typically, the views share their name with the associated controller action, as you can see above.
For example, the index controller action of the <code>articles_controller.rb</code> will use the <code>index.html.erb</code> view file in the <code>app/views/articles</code> directory.
The complete HTML returned to the client is composed of a combination of this ERB file, a layout template that wraps it, and all the partials that the view may reference. Within this guide, you will find more detailed documentation about each of these three components.</p>
