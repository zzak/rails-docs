<p>When you create a new Rails application, you will need to choose between import maps and a
JavaScript bundling solution. Every application has different requirements, and you should
consider your requirements carefully before choosing a JavaScript option, as migrating from one
option to another may be time-consuming for large, complex applications.</p>

<p>Import maps are the default option because the Rails team believes in import maps' potential for
reducing complexity, improving developer experience, and delivering performance gains.</p>

<p>For many applications, especially those that rely primarily on the <a href="https://hotwired.dev/">Hotwire</a>
stack for their JavaScript needs, import maps will be the right option for the long term. You
can read more about the reasoning behind making import maps the default in Rails 7
<a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/rails-7-will-have-three-great-answers-to-javascript-in-2021-8d68191b">here</a>.</p>

<p>Other applications may still need a traditional JavaScript bundler. Requirements that indicate
that you should choose a traditional bundler include:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your code requires a transpilation step, such as JSX or TypeScript.</li>
<li>If you need to use JavaScript libraries that include CSS or otherwise rely on
<a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/">Webpack loaders</a>.</li>
<li>If you are absolutely sure that you need
<a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/">tree-shaking</a>.</li>
<li>If you will install Bootstrap, Bulma, PostCSS, or Dart CSS through the
<a href="https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails">cssbundling-rails gem</a>. All options provided by this
gem except Tailwind will automatically install <code>esbuild</code> for you if you do not specify a different
option in <code>rails new</code>.</li>
</ul>
