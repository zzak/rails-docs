<p>Beyond reporting issues, you can help the core team resolve existing ones by providing feedback about them. If you are new to Rails core development, that might be a great way to walk your first steps, you'll get familiar with the codebase and the processes.</p>

<p>If you check the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">issues list</a> in GitHub Issues, you'll find lots of issues already requiring attention. What can you do about these? Quite a bit, actually:</p>

<h4 id="verifying-bug-reports"><a class="anchorlink" href="#verifying-bug-reports">2.1 Verifying Bug Reports</a></h4>

<p>For starters, it helps just to verify bug reports. Can you reproduce the reported issue on your computer? If so, you can add a comment to the issue saying that you're seeing the same thing.</p>

<p>If an issue is very vague, can you help narrow it down to something more specific? Maybe you can provide additional information to reproduce the bug, or maybe you can eliminate unnecessary steps that aren't required to demonstrate the problem.</p>

<p>If you find a bug report without a test, it's very useful to contribute a failing test. This is also a great way to explore the source code: looking at the existing test files will teach you how to write more tests. New tests are best contributed in the form of a patch, as explained later on in the <a href="#contributing-to-the-rails-code">Contributing to the Rails Code</a> section.</p>

<p>Anything you can do to make bug reports more succinct or easier to reproduce helps folks trying to write code to fix those bugs - whether you end up writing the code yourself or not.</p>

<h4 id="testing-patches"><a class="anchorlink" href="#testing-patches">2.2 Testing Patches</a></h4>

<p>You can also help out by examining pull requests that have been submitted to Ruby on Rails via GitHub. In order to apply someone's changes, first create a dedicated branch:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">git </span>checkout <span class="nt">-b</span> testing_branch
</code></pre>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-text="git checkout -b testing_branch
">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>Then, you can use their remote branch to update your codebase. For example, let's say the GitHub user JohnSmith has forked and pushed to a topic branch "orange" located at <a href="https://github.com/JohnSmith/rails">https://github.com/JohnSmith/rails</a>.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">git </span>remote add JohnSmith https://github.com/JohnSmith/rails.git
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">git </span>pull JohnSmith orange
</code></pre>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-text="git remote add JohnSmith https://github.com/JohnSmith/rails.git
git pull JohnSmith orange
">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>After applying their branch, test it out! Here are some things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the change actually work?</li>
<li>Are you happy with the tests? Can you follow what they're testing? Are there any tests missing?</li>
<li>Does it have the proper documentation coverage? Should documentation elsewhere be updated?</li>
<li>Do you like the implementation? Can you think of a nicer or faster way to implement a part of their change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you're happy that the pull request contains a good change, comment on the GitHub issue indicating your approval. Your comment should indicate that you like the change and what you like about it. Something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like the way you've restructured that code in generate_finder_sql - much nicer. The tests look good too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your comment simply reads "+1", then odds are that other reviewers aren't going to take it too seriously. Show that you took the time to review the pull request.</p>
