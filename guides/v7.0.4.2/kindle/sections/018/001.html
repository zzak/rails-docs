<p>Most WYSIWYG editors are wrappers around HTMLâ€™s <code>contenteditable</code> and <code>execCommand</code> APIs,
designed by Microsoft to support live editing of web pages in Internet Explorer 5.5,
and <a href="https://blog.whatwg.org/the-road-to-html-5-contenteditable#history">eventually reverse-engineered</a>
and copied by other browsers.</p>

<p>Because these APIs were never fully specified or documented,
and because WYSIWYG HTML editors are enormous in scope, each
browser's implementation has its own set of bugs and quirks,
and JavaScript developers are left to resolve the inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Trix sidesteps these inconsistencies by treating contenteditable
as an I/O device: when input makes its way to the editor, Trix converts that input
into an editing operation on its internal document model, then re-renders
that document back into the editor. This gives Trix complete control over what
happens after every keystroke, and avoids the need to use execCommand at all.</p>
