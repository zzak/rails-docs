<h3 id="terminology"><a class="anchorlink" href="#terminology">2 Terminology</a></h3>
<p>Action Cable uses WebSockets instead of the HTTP request-response protocol.
Both Action Cable and WebSockets introduce some less familiar terminology:</p>

<h4 id="terminology-connections"><a class="anchorlink" href="#terminology-connections">2.1 Connections</a></h4>

<p><em>Connections</em> form the foundation of the client-server relationship.
A single Action Cable server can handle multiple connection instances. It has one
connection instance per WebSocket connection. A single user may have multiple
WebSockets open to your application if they use multiple browser tabs or devices.</p>

<h4 id="consumers"><a class="anchorlink" href="#consumers">2.2 Consumers</a></h4>

<p>The client of a WebSocket connection is called the <em>consumer</em>. In Action Cable,
the consumer is created by the client-side JavaScript framework.</p>

<h4 id="terminology-channels"><a class="anchorlink" href="#terminology-channels">2.3 Channels</a></h4>

<p>Each consumer can, in turn, subscribe to multiple <em>channels</em>. Each channel
encapsulates a logical unit of work, similar to what a controller does in
a typical MVC setup. For example, you could have a <code>ChatChannel</code> and
an <code>AppearancesChannel</code>, and a consumer could be subscribed to either
or both of these channels. At the very least, a consumer should be subscribed
to one channel.</p>

<h4 id="subscribers"><a class="anchorlink" href="#subscribers">2.4 Subscribers</a></h4>

<p>When the consumer is subscribed to a channel, they act as a <em>subscriber</em>.
The connection between the subscriber and the channel is, surprise-surprise,
called a subscription. A consumer can act as a subscriber to a given channel
any number of times. For example, a consumer could subscribe to multiple chat rooms
at the same time. (And remember that a physical user may have multiple consumers,
one per tab/device open to your connection).</p>

<h4 id="pub-sub"><a class="anchorlink" href="#pub-sub">2.5 Pub/Sub</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">Pub/Sub</a> or
Publish-Subscribe refers to a message queue paradigm whereby senders of
information (publishers), send data to an abstract class of recipients
(subscribers), without specifying individual recipients. Action Cable uses this
approach to communicate between the server and many clients.</p>

<h4 id="terminology-broadcastings"><a class="anchorlink" href="#terminology-broadcastings">2.6 Broadcastings</a></h4>

<p>A broadcasting is a pub/sub link where anything transmitted by the broadcaster is
sent directly to the channel subscribers who are streaming that named broadcasting.
Each channel can be streaming zero or more broadcastings.</p>
