<p>The instrumentation API provided by Active Support allows developers to provide hooks which other developers may hook into. There are several of these within the <a href="#rails-framework-hooks">Rails framework</a>. With this API, developers can choose to be notified when certain events occur inside their application or another piece of Ruby code.</p>

<p>For example, there is a hook provided within Active Record that is called every time Active Record uses an SQL query on a database. This hook could be <strong>subscribed</strong> to, and used to track the number of queries during a certain action. There's another hook around the processing of an action of a controller. This could be used, for instance, to track how long a specific action has taken.</p>

<p>You are even able to <a href="#creating-custom-events">create your own events</a> inside your application which you can later subscribe to.</p>
