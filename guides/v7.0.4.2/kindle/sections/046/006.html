<p>In predicates and flags prefer documenting boolean semantics over exact values.</p>

<p>When "true" or "false" are used as defined in Ruby use regular font. The
singletons <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> need fixed-width font. Please avoid terms like
"truthy", Ruby defines what is true and false in the language, and thus those
words have a technical meaning and need no substitutes.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, do not document singletons unless absolutely necessary. That
prevents artificial constructs like <code>!!</code> or ternaries, allows refactors, and the
code does not need to rely on the exact values returned by methods being called
in the implementation.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight markdown"><span class="sb">`config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries`</span> specifies whether mail will actually be delivered and is true by default
</code></pre>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-text="`config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries` specifies whether mail will actually be delivered and is true by default
">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>the user does not need to know which is the actual default value of the flag,
and so we only document its boolean semantics.</p>

<p>An example with a predicate:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="c1"># Returns true if the collection is empty.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># If the collection has been loaded</span>
<span class="c1"># it is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;collection.size.zero?&lt;/tt&gt;. If the</span>
<span class="c1"># collection has not been loaded, it is equivalent to</span>
<span class="c1"># &lt;tt&gt;!collection.exists?&lt;/tt&gt;. If the collection has not already been</span>
<span class="c1"># loaded and you are going to fetch the records anyway it is better to</span>
<span class="c1"># check &lt;tt&gt;collection.length.zero?&lt;/tt&gt;.</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">empty?</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">loaded?</span>
    <span class="n">size</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">zero?</span>
  <span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="vi">@target</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">blank?</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">exists?</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-text="# Returns true if the collection is empty.
#
# If the collection has been loaded
# it is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;collection.size.zero?&lt;/tt&gt;. If the
# collection has not been loaded, it is equivalent to
# &lt;tt&gt;!collection.exists?&lt;/tt&gt;. If the collection has not already been
# loaded and you are going to fetch the records anyway it is better to
# check &lt;tt&gt;collection.length.zero?&lt;/tt&gt;.
def empty?
  if loaded?
    size.zero?
  else
    @target.blank? &amp;&amp; !scope.exists?
  end
end
">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>The API is careful not to commit to any particular value, the method has
predicate semantics, that's enough.</p>
