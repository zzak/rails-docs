<p>Only the latest release series will receive bug fixes. Bug fixes are typically
added to the main branch, and backported to the x-y-stable branch of the latest
release series if there is sufficient need. When enough bugs fixes have been added
to an x-y-stable branch, a new patch release is built from it. For example, a
theoretical 1.2.2 patch release would be built from the 1-2-stable branch.</p>

<p>In special situations, where someone from the Core Team agrees to support more series,
they are included in the list of supported series.</p>

<p><strong>Currently included series:</strong> <code>7.0.Z</code>.</p>
