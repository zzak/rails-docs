<p>The current release series and the next most recent one will receive patches
and new versions in case of a security issue.</p>

<p>These releases are created by taking the last released version, applying the
security patches, and releasing. Those patches are then applied to the end of
the x-y-stable branch. For example, a theoretical 1.2.2.1 security release would
be built from 1.2.2, and then added to the end of 1-2-stable. This means that
security releases are easy to upgrade to if you're running the latest version
of Rails.</p>

<p>Only direct security patches will be included in security releases. Fixes for
non-security related bugs resulting from a security patch may be published on a
release's x-y-stable branch, and will only be released as a new gem in
accordance with the Bug Fixes policy.</p>

<p><strong>Currently included series:</strong> <code>7.0.Z</code>, <code>6.1.Z</code>.</p>
