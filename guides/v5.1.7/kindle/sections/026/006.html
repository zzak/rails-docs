<h3 id="require-dependency">7 require_dependency</h3>
<p>Constant autoloading is triggered on demand and therefore code that uses a
certain constant may have it already defined or may trigger an autoload. That
depends on the execution path and it may vary between runs.</p>

<p>There are times, however, in which you want to make sure a certain constant is
known when the execution reaches some code. <code>require_dependency</code> provides a way
to load a file using the current <a href="#loading-mechanism">loading mechanism</a>, and
keeping track of constants defined in that file as if they were autoloaded to
have them reloaded as needed.</p>

<p><code>require_dependency</code> is rarely needed, but see a couple of use-cases in
<a href="#autoloading-and-sti">Autoloading and STI</a> and <a href="#when-constants-aren-t-missed">When Constants aren't
Triggered</a>.</p>

<div class="warning"><p>Unlike autoloading, <code>require_dependency</code> does not expect the file to
define any particular constant. Exploiting this behavior would be a bad practice
though, file and constant paths should match.</p></div>
