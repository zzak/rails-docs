<h3 id="autoload-paths">5 autoload_paths</h3>
<p>As you probably know, when <code>require</code> gets a relative file name:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'erb'

</pre>
</div>
<p>Ruby looks for the file in the directories listed in <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>. That is, Ruby
iterates over all its directories and for each one of them checks whether they
have a file called "erb.rb", or "erb.so", or "erb.o", or "erb.dll". If it finds
any of them, the interpreter loads it and ends the search. Otherwise, it tries
again in the next directory of the list. If the list gets exhausted, <code>LoadError</code>
is raised.</p>

<p>We are going to cover how constant autoloading works in more detail later, but
the idea is that when a constant like <code>Post</code> is hit and missing, if there's a
<code>post.rb</code> file for example in <code>app/models</code> Rails is going to find it, evaluate
it, and have <code>Post</code> defined as a side-effect.</p>

<p>Alright, Rails has a collection of directories similar to <code>$LOAD_PATH</code> in which
to look up <code>post.rb</code>. That collection is called <code>autoload_paths</code> and by
default it contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>All subdirectories of <code>app</code> in the application and engines present at boot
time. For example, <code>app/controllers</code>. They do not need to be the default
ones, any custom directories like <code>app/workers</code> belong automatically to
<code>autoload_paths</code>.</li>
<li>Any existing second level directories called <code>app/*/concerns</code> in the
application and engines.</li>
<li>The directory <code>test/mailers/previews</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this collection is configurable via <code>config.autoload_paths</code>. For example,
<code>lib</code> was in the list years ago, but no longer is. An application can opt-in
by adding this to <code>config/application.rb</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.autoload_paths &lt;&lt; "#{Rails.root}/lib"

</pre>
</div>
<p><code>config.autoload_paths</code> is not changeable from environment-specific configuration files.</p>

<p>The value of <code>autoload_paths</code> can be inspected. In a just generated application
it is (edited):</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rails r 'puts ActiveSupport::Dependencies.autoload_paths'
.../app/assets
.../app/controllers
.../app/helpers
.../app/mailers
.../app/models
.../app/controllers/concerns
.../app/models/concerns
.../test/mailers/previews

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p><code>autoload_paths</code> is computed and cached during the initialization process.
The application needs to be restarted to reflect any changes in the directory
structure.</p></div>
</body>
