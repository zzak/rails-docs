<h3 id="migration-overview">1 Migration Overview</h3>
<p>Migrations are a convenient way to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration">alter your database schema over time</a>
in a consistent and easy way. They use a Ruby DSL so that you don't have to
write SQL by hand, allowing your schema and changes to be database independent.</p>

<p>You can think of each migration as being a new 'version' of the database. A
schema starts off with nothing in it, and each migration modifies it to add or
remove tables, columns, or entries. Active Record knows how to update your
schema along this timeline, bringing it from whatever point it is in the
history to the latest version. Active Record will also update your
<code>db/schema.rb</code> file to match the up-to-date structure of your database.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a migration:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class CreateProducts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.text :description

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This migration adds a table called <code>products</code> with a string column called
<code>name</code> and a text column called <code>description</code>. A primary key column called <code>id</code>
will also be added implicitly, as it's the default primary key for all Active
Record models. The <code>timestamps</code> macro adds two columns, <code>created_at</code> and
<code>updated_at</code>. These special columns are automatically managed by Active Record
if they exist.</p>

<p>Note that we define the change that we want to happen moving forward in time.
Before this migration is run, there will be no table. After, the table will
exist. Active Record knows how to reverse this migration as well: if we roll
this migration back, it will remove the table.</p>

<p>On databases that support transactions with statements that change the schema,
migrations are wrapped in a transaction. If the database does not support this
then when a migration fails the parts of it that succeeded will not be rolled
back. You will have to rollback the changes that were made by hand.</p>

<div class="note"><p>There are certain queries that can't run inside a transaction. If your
adapter supports DDL transactions you can use <code>disable_ddl_transaction!</code> to
disable them for a single migration.</p></div>

<p>If you wish for a migration to do something that Active Record doesn't know how
to reverse, you can use <code>reversible</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ChangeProductsPrice &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    reversible do |dir|
      change_table :products do |t|
        dir.up   { t.change :price, :string }
        dir.down { t.change :price, :integer }
      end
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, you can use <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> instead of <code>change</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ChangeProductsPrice &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def up
    change_table :products do |t|
      t.change :price, :string
    end
  end

  def down
    change_table :products do |t|
      t.change :price, :integer
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
</body>
</html>
