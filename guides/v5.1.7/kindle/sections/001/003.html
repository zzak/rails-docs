<h3 id="hello-rails-bang">4 Hello, Rails!</h3>
<p>To begin with, let's get some text up on screen quickly. To do this, you need to
get your Rails application server running.</p>

<h4 id="starting-up-the-web-server">4.1 Starting up the Web Server</h4>

<p>You actually have a functional Rails application already. To see it, you need to
start a web server on your development machine. You can do this by running the
following in the <code>blog</code> directory:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rails server

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p>If you are using Windows, you have to pass the scripts under the <code>bin</code>
folder directly to the Ruby interpreter e.g. <code>ruby bin\rails server</code>.</p></div>

<div class="info"><p>Compiling CoffeeScript and JavaScript asset compression requires you
have a JavaScript runtime available on your system, in the absence
of a runtime you will see an <code>execjs</code> error during asset compilation.
Usually macOS and Windows come with a JavaScript runtime installed.
Rails adds the <code>therubyracer</code> gem to the generated <code>Gemfile</code> in a
commented line for new apps and you can uncomment if you need it.
<code>therubyrhino</code> is the recommended runtime for JRuby users and is added by
default to the <code>Gemfile</code> in apps generated under JRuby. You can investigate
all the supported runtimes at <a href="https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme">ExecJS</a>.</p></div>

<p>This will fire up Puma, a web server distributed with Rails by default. To see
your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to
<a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>. You should see the Rails default information page:</p>

<p><img src="/home/rails/v5.1.7/guides/output/kindle/images/getting_started/rails_welcome.png" alt="Welcome aboard screenshot"></p>

<div class="info"><p>To stop the web server, hit Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it's
running. To verify the server has stopped you should see your command prompt
cursor again. For most UNIX-like systems including macOS this will be a
dollar sign <code>$</code>. In development mode, Rails does not generally require you to
restart the server; changes you make in files will be automatically picked up by
the server.</p></div>

<p>The "Welcome aboard" page is the <em>smoke test</em> for a new Rails application: it
makes sure that you have your software configured correctly enough to serve a
page.</p>

<h4 id="say-hello-rails">4.2 Say "Hello", Rails</h4>

<p>To get Rails saying "Hello", you need to create at minimum a <em>controller</em> and a
<em>view</em>.</p>

<p>A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application.
<em>Routing</em> decides which controller receives which requests. Often, there is more
than one route to each controller, and different routes can be served by
different <em>actions</em>. Each action's purpose is to collect information to provide
it to a view.</p>

<p>A view's purpose is to display this information in a human readable format. An
important distinction to make is that it is the <em>controller</em>, not the view,
where information is collected. The view should just display that information.
By default, view templates are written in a language called eRuby (Embedded
Ruby) which is processed by the request cycle in Rails before being sent to the
user.</p>

<p>To create a new controller, you will need to run the "controller" generator and
tell it you want a controller called "Welcome" with an action called "index",
just like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rails generate controller Welcome index

</pre>
</div>
<p>Rails will create several files and a route for you.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
create  app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb
 route  get 'welcome/index'
invoke  erb
create    app/views/welcome
create    app/views/welcome/index.html.erb
invoke  test_unit
create    test/controllers/welcome_controller_test.rb
invoke  helper
create    app/helpers/welcome_helper.rb
invoke    test_unit
invoke  assets
invoke    coffee
create      app/assets/javascripts/welcome.coffee
invoke    scss
create      app/assets/stylesheets/welcome.scss

</pre>
</div>
<p>Most important of these are of course the controller, located at
<code>app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb</code> and the view, located at
<code>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</code>.</p>

<p>Open the <code>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</code> file in your text editor. Delete all
of the existing code in the file, and replace it with the following single line
of code:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Rails!&lt;/h1&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="setting-the-application-home-page">4.3 Setting the Application Home Page</h4>

<p>Now that we have made the controller and view, we need to tell Rails when we
want "Hello, Rails!" to show up. In our case, we want it to show up when we
navigate to the root URL of our site, <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>. At the moment,
"Welcome aboard" is occupying that spot.</p>

<p>Next, you have to tell Rails where your actual home page is located.</p>

<p>Open the file <code>config/routes.rb</code> in your editor.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This is your application's <em>routing file</em> which holds entries in a special
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL (domain-specific language)</a>
that tells Rails how to connect incoming requests to
controllers and actions.
Edit this file by adding the line of code <code>root 'welcome#index'</code>.
It should look something like the following:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'welcome/index'

  root 'welcome#index'
end

</pre>
</div>
<p><code>root 'welcome#index'</code> tells Rails to map requests to the root of the
application to the welcome controller's index action and <code>get 'welcome/index'</code>
tells Rails to map requests to <a href="http://localhost:3000/welcome/index">http://localhost:3000/welcome/index</a> to the
welcome controller's index action. This was created earlier when you ran the
controller generator (<code>bin/rails generate controller Welcome index</code>).</p>

<p>Launch the web server again if you stopped it to generate the controller (<code>bin/rails
server</code>) and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser. You'll see the
"Hello, Rails!" message you put into <code>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</code>,
indicating that this new route is indeed going to <code>WelcomeController</code>'s <code>index</code>
action and is rendering the view correctly.</p>
