<h4 id="example-1-user-appearances">6.1 Example 1: User Appearances</h4>

<p>Here's a simple example of a channel that tracks whether a user is online or not
and what page they're on. (This is useful for creating presence features like showing
a green dot next to a user name if they're online).</p>

<p>Create the server-side appearance channel:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/channels/appearance_channel.rb
class AppearanceChannel &lt; ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    current_user.appear
  end

  def unsubscribed
    current_user.disappear
  end

  def appear(data)
    current_user.appear(on: data['appearing_on'])
  end

  def away
    current_user.away
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>When a subscription is initiated the <code>subscribed</code> callback gets fired and we
take that opportunity to say "the current user has indeed appeared". That
appear/disappear API could be backed by Redis, a database, or whatever else.</p>

<p>Create the client-side appearance channel subscription:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/assets/javascripts/cable/subscriptions/appearance.coffee
App.cable.subscriptions.create "AppearanceChannel",
  # Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server.
  connected: -&gt;
    @install()
    @appear()

  # Called when the WebSocket connection is closed.
  disconnected: -&gt;
    @uninstall()

  # Called when the subscription is rejected by the server.
  rejected: -&gt;
    @uninstall()

  appear: -&gt;
    # Calls `AppearanceChannel#appear(data)` on the server.
    @perform("appear", appearing_on: $("main").data("appearing-on"))

  away: -&gt;
    # Calls `AppearanceChannel#away` on the server.
    @perform("away")


  buttonSelector = "[data-behavior~=appear_away]"

  install: -&gt;
    $(document).on "turbolinks:load.appearance", =&gt;
      @appear()

    $(document).on "click.appearance", buttonSelector, =&gt;
      @away()
      false

    $(buttonSelector).show()

  uninstall: -&gt;
    $(document).off(".appearance")
    $(buttonSelector).hide()

</pre>
</div>
<h6 id="client-server-interaction">6.1.1 Client-Server Interaction</h6>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Client</strong> connects to the <strong>Server</strong> via <code>App.cable =
ActionCable.createConsumer("ws://cable.example.com")</code>. (<code>cable.js</code>). The
<strong>Server</strong> identifies this connection by <code>current_user</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Client</strong> subscribes to the appearance channel via
<code>App.cable.subscriptions.create(channel: "AppearanceChannel")</code>. (<code>appearance.coffee</code>)</li>
<li>
<strong>Server</strong> recognizes a new subscription has been initiated for the
appearance channel and runs its <code>subscribed</code> callback, calling the <code>appear</code>
method on <code>current_user</code>. (<code>appearance_channel.rb</code>)</li>
<li>
<strong>Client</strong> recognizes that a subscription has been established and calls
<code>connected</code> (<code>appearance.coffee</code>) which in turn calls <code>@install</code> and <code>@appear</code>.
<code>@appear</code> calls <code>AppearanceChannel#appear(data)</code> on the server, and supplies a
data hash of <code>{ appearing_on: $("main").data("appearing-on") }</code>. This is
possible because the server-side channel instance automatically exposes all
public methods declared on the class (minus the callbacks), so that these can be
reached as remote procedure calls via a subscription's <code>perform</code> method.</li>
<li>
<strong>Server</strong> receives the request for the <code>appear</code> action on the appearance
channel for the connection identified by <code>current_user</code>
(<code>appearance_channel.rb</code>). <strong>Server</strong> retrieves the data with the
<code>:appearing_on</code> key from the data hash and sets it as the value for the <code>:on</code>
key being passed to <code>current_user.appear</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="example-2-receiving-new-web-notifications">6.2 Example 2: Receiving New Web Notifications</h4>

<p>The appearance example was all about exposing server functionality to
client-side invocation over the WebSocket connection. But the great thing
about WebSockets is that it's a two-way street. So now let's show an example
where the server invokes an action on the client.</p>

<p>This is a web notification channel that allows you to trigger client-side
web notifications when you broadcast to the right streams:</p>

<p>Create the server-side web notifications channel:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/channels/web_notifications_channel.rb
class WebNotificationsChannel &lt; ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    stream_for current_user
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Create the client-side web notifications channel subscription:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/assets/javascripts/cable/subscriptions/web_notifications.coffee
# Client-side which assumes you've already requested
# the right to send web notifications.
App.cable.subscriptions.create "WebNotificationsChannel",
  received: (data) -&gt;
    new Notification data["title"], body: data["body"]

</pre>
</div>
<p>Broadcast content to a web notification channel instance from elsewhere in your
application:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# Somewhere in your app this is called, perhaps from a NewCommentJob
WebNotificationsChannel.broadcast_to(
  current_user,
  title: 'New things!',
  body: 'All the news fit to print'
)

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>WebNotificationsChannel.broadcast_to</code> call places a message in the current
subscription adapter's pubsub queue under a separate broadcasting name for each
user. For a user with an ID of 1, the broadcasting name would be
<code>web_notifications:1</code>.</p>

<p>The channel has been instructed to stream everything that arrives at
<code>web_notifications:1</code> directly to the client by invoking the <code>received</code>
callback. The data passed as argument is the hash sent as the second parameter
to the server-side broadcast call, JSON encoded for the trip across the wire,
and unpacked for the data argument arriving to <code>received</code>.</p>
