<h3 id="what-are-on-load-hooks-questionmark">8 What are <code>on_load</code> hooks?</h3>
<p>Since Ruby is a dynamic language, some code will cause different Rails frameworks to load. Take this snippet for instance:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
ActiveRecord::Base.include(MyActiveRecordHelper)

</pre>
</div>
<p>This snippet means that when this file is loaded, it will encounter <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>. This encounter causes Ruby to look for the definition of that constant and will require it. This causes the entire Active Record framework to be loaded on boot.</p>

<p><code>ActiveSupport.on_load</code> is a mechanism that can be used to defer the loading of code until it is actually needed. The snippet above can be changed to:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) { include MyActiveRecordHelper }

</pre>
</div>
<p>This new snippet will only include <code>MyActiveRecordHelper</code> when <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> is loaded.</p>
</body>
