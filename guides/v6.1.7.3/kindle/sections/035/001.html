<p>The first question a lot of people have when thinking about building a JSON API
using Rails is: "isn't using Rails to spit out some JSON overkill? Shouldn't I
just use something like Sinatra?".</p>

<p>For very simple APIs, this may be true. However, even in very HTML-heavy
applications, most of an application's logic lives outside of the view
layer.</p>

<p>The reason most people use Rails is that it provides a set of defaults that
allows developers to get up and running quickly, without having to make a lot of trivial
decisions.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at some of the things that Rails provides out of the box that are
still applicable to API applications.</p>

<p>Handled at the middleware layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reloading: Rails applications support transparent reloading. This works even if
your application gets big and restarting the server for every request becomes
non-viable.</li>
<li>Development Mode: Rails applications come with smart defaults for development,
making development pleasant without compromising production-time performance.</li>
<li>Test Mode: Ditto development mode.</li>
<li>Logging: Rails applications log every request, with a level of verbosity
appropriate for the current mode. Rails logs in development include information
about the request environment, database queries, and basic performance
information.</li>
<li>Security: Rails detects and thwarts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing">IP spoofing
attacks</a> and handles
cryptographic signatures in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing
attack</a> aware way. Don't know what
an IP spoofing attack or a timing attack is? Exactly.</li>
<li>Parameter Parsing: Want to specify your parameters as JSON instead of as a
URL-encoded String? No problem. Rails will decode the JSON for you and make
it available in <code>params</code>. Want to use nested URL-encoded parameters? That
works too.</li>
<li>Conditional GETs: Rails handles conditional <code>GET</code> (<code>ETag</code> and <code>Last-Modified</code>)
processing request headers and returning the correct response headers and status
code. All you need to do is use the
<a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.1.7.3/classes/ActionController/ConditionalGet.html#method-i-stale-3F"><code>stale?</code></a>
check in your controller, and Rails will handle all of the HTTP details for you.</li>
<li>HEAD requests: Rails will transparently convert <code>HEAD</code> requests into <code>GET</code> ones,
and return just the headers on the way out. This makes <code>HEAD</code> work reliably in
all Rails APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>While you could obviously build these up in terms of existing Rack middleware,
this list demonstrates that the default Rails middleware stack provides a lot
of value, even if you're "just generating JSON".</p>

<p>Handled at the Action Pack layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resourceful Routing: If you're building a RESTful JSON API, you want to be
using the Rails router. Clean and conventional mapping from HTTP to controllers
means not having to spend time thinking about how to model your API in terms
of HTTP.</li>
<li>URL Generation: The flip side of routing is URL generation. A good API based
on HTTP includes URLs (see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/gists">the GitHub Gist API</a>
for an example).</li>
<li>Header and Redirection Responses: <code>head :no_content</code> and
<code>redirect_to user_url(current_user)</code> come in handy. Sure, you could manually
add the response headers, but why?</li>
<li>Caching: Rails provides page, action, and fragment caching. Fragment caching
is especially helpful when building up a nested JSON object.</li>
<li>Basic, Digest, and Token Authentication: Rails comes with out-of-the-box support
for three kinds of HTTP authentication.</li>
<li>Instrumentation: Rails has an instrumentation API that triggers registered
handlers for a variety of events, such as action processing, sending a file or
data, redirection, and database queries. The payload of each event comes with
relevant information (for the action processing event, the payload includes
the controller, action, parameters, request format, request method, and the
request's full path).</li>
<li>Generators: It is often handy to generate a resource and get your model,
controller, test stubs, and routes created for you in a single command for
further tweaking. Same for migrations and others.</li>
<li>Plugins: Many third-party libraries come with support for Rails that reduce
or eliminate the cost of setting up and gluing together the library and the
web framework. This includes things like overriding default generators, adding
Rake tasks, and honoring Rails choices (like the logger and cache back-end).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the Rails boot process also glues together all registered components.
For example, the Rails boot process is what uses your <code>config/database.yml</code> file
when configuring Active Record.</p>

<p><strong>The short version is</strong>: you may not have thought about which parts of Rails
are still applicable even if you remove the view layer, but the answer turns out
to be most of it.</p>
