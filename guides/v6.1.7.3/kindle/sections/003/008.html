<p>The <code>db/schema.rb</code> or <code>db/structure.sql</code> is a snapshot of the current state of your
database and is the authoritative source for rebuilding that database. This
makes it possible to delete old migration files.</p>

<p>When you delete migration files in the <code>db/migrate/</code> directory, any environment
where <code>bin/rails db:migrate</code> was run when those files still existed will hold a reference
to the migration timestamp specific to them inside an internal Rails database
table named <code>schema_migrations</code>. This table is used to keep track of whether
migrations have been executed in a specific environment.</p>

<p>If you run the <code>bin/rails db:migrate:status</code> command, which displays the status
(up or down) of each migration, you should see <code>********** NO FILE **********</code>
displayed next to any deleted migration file which was once executed on a
specific environment but can no longer be found in the <code>db/migrate/</code> directory.</p>

<p>There's a caveat, though. Rake tasks to install migrations from engines are idempotent. Migrations present in the parent application due to a previous installation are skipped, and missing ones are copied with a new leading timestamp. If you deleted old engine migrations and ran the install task again, you'd get new files with new timestamps, and <code>db:migrate</code> would attempt to run them again.</p>

<p>Thus, you generally want to preserve migrations coming from engines. They have a special comment like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight plaintext"># This migration comes from blorgh (originally 20210621082949)
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-4fb3e47d823a9d598d4d6432cc989139"># This migration comes from blorgh (originally 20210621082949)
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-4fb3e47d823a9d598d4d6432cc989139">Copy</button>
