<p>The Rails framework components use these tools to manage their own concurrency
needs too.</p>

<p><code>ActionDispatch::Executor</code> and <code>ActionDispatch::Reloader</code> are Rack middlewares
that wrap requests with a supplied Executor or Reloader, respectively. They
are automatically included in the default application stack. The Reloader will
ensure any arriving HTTP request is served with a freshly-loaded copy of the
application if any code changes have occurred.</p>

<p>Active Job also wraps its job executions with the Reloader, loading the latest
code to execute each job as it comes off the queue.</p>

<p>Action Cable uses the Executor instead: because a Cable connection is linked to
a specific instance of a class, it's not possible to reload for every arriving
WebSocket message. Only the message handler is wrapped, though; a long-running
Cable connection does not prevent a reload that's triggered by a new incoming
request or job. Instead, Action Cable uses the Reloader's <code>before_class_unload</code>
callback to disconnect all its connections. When the client automatically
reconnects, it will be speaking to the new version of the code.</p>

<p>The above are the entry points to the framework, so they are responsible for
ensuring their respective threads are protected, and deciding whether a reload
is necessary. Other components only need to use the Executor when they spawn
additional threads.</p>

<h4 id="configuration"><a class="anchorlink" href="#configuration">4.1 Configuration</a></h4>

<p>The Reloader only checks for file changes when <code>cache_classes</code> is false and
<code>reload_classes_only_on_change</code> is true (which is the default in the
<code>development</code> environment).</p>

<p>When <code>cache_classes</code> is true (in <code>production</code>, by default), the Reloader is only
a pass-through to the Executor.</p>

<p>The Executor always has important work to do, like database connection
management. When <code>cache_classes</code> and <code>eager_load</code> are both true (<code>production</code>),
no autoloading or class reloading will occur, so it does not need the Load
Interlock. If either of those are false (<code>development</code>), then the Executor will
use the Load Interlock to ensure constants are only loaded when it is safe.</p>
