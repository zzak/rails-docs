<p>Active Record is the M in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> - the
model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business
data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business
objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database. It is an
implementation of the Active Record pattern which itself is a description of an
Object Relational Mapping system.</p>

<h4 id="the-active-record-pattern"><a class="anchorlink" href="#the-active-record-pattern">1.1 The Active Record Pattern</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html">Active Record was described by Martin Fowler</a>
in his book <em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em>. In
Active Record, objects carry both persistent data and behavior which
operates on that data. Active Record takes the opinion that ensuring
data access logic as part of the object will educate users of that
object on how to write to and read from the database.</p>

<h4 id="object-relational-mapping"><a class="anchorlink" href="#object-relational-mapping">1.2 Object Relational Mapping</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">Object Relational Mapping</a>, commonly referred to as its abbreviation ORM, is
a technique that connects the rich objects of an application to tables in
a relational database management system. Using ORM, the properties and
relationships of the objects in an application can be easily stored and
retrieved from a database without writing SQL statements directly and with less
overall database access code.</p>

<div class="note"><p>Basic knowledge of relational database management systems (RDBMS) and structured query language (SQL) is helpful in order to fully understand Active Record. Please refer to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp">this tutorial</a> (or <a href="http://www.sqlcourse.com/">this one</a>) or study them by other means if you would like to learn more.</p></div>

<p>Active Record gives us several mechanisms, the most important being the ability
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Represent models and their data.</li>
<li>Represent associations between these models.</li>
<li>Represent inheritance hierarchies through related models.</li>
<li>Validate models before they get persisted to the database.</li>
<li>Perform database operations in an object-oriented fashion.</li>
</ul>
