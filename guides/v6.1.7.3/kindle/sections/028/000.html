<h3 id="what-is-the-asset-pipeline-questionmark"><a class="anchorlink" href="#what-is-the-asset-pipeline-questionmark">1 What is the Asset Pipeline?</a></h3>
<p>The asset pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress
JavaScript and CSS assets. It also adds the ability to write these assets in
other languages and pre-processors such as CoffeeScript, Sass, and ERB.
It allows assets in your application to be automatically combined with assets
from other gems.</p>

<p>The asset pipeline is implemented by the
<a href="https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails">sprockets-rails</a> gem,
and is enabled by default. You can disable it while creating a new application by
passing the <code>--skip-sprockets</code> option.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">rails </span>new appname <span class="nt">--skip-sprockets</span>
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-7a689aee33491af6a2ed8353fc3c9ace">rails new appname --skip-sprockets
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-7a689aee33491af6a2ed8353fc3c9ace">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>Rails automatically adds the <a href="https://github.com/rails/sass-rails"><code>sass-rails</code></a>
gem to your <code>Gemfile</code>, which is used by Sprockets for
<a href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> compilation:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'sass-rails'</span>
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-379ae8121215eb87bf7725762da7336c">gem 'sass-rails'
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-379ae8121215eb87bf7725762da7336c">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>Using the <code>--skip-sprockets</code> option will prevent Rails from adding
this gem, so if you later want to enable the asset pipeline
you will have to add it to your <code>Gemfile</code> manually. Also,
creating an application with the <code>--skip-sprockets</code> option will generate
a slightly different <code>config/application.rb</code> file, with a require statement
for the sprockets railtie that is commented-out. You will have to remove
the comment operator on that line to later enable the asset pipeline:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="c1"># require "sprockets/railtie"</span>
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-865b76326897e1ac133a4b328eb6087b"># require "sprockets/railtie"
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-865b76326897e1ac133a4b328eb6087b">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>To set asset compression methods, set the appropriate configuration options
in <code>production.rb</code> - <code>config.assets.css_compressor</code> for your CSS and
<code>config.assets.js_compressor</code> for your JavaScript:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">assets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">css_compressor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:yui</span>
<span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">assets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">js_compressor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:uglifier</span>
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-a4925b0ab8b08b7e7dce5def70061eed">config.assets.css_compressor = :yui
config.assets.js_compressor = :uglifier
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-a4925b0ab8b08b7e7dce5def70061eed">Copy</button>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>The <code>sass-rails</code> gem is automatically used for CSS compression if included
in the <code>Gemfile</code> and no <code>config.assets.css_compressor</code> option is set.</p></div>

<h4 id="main-features"><a class="anchorlink" href="#main-features">1.1 Main Features</a></h4>

<p>The first feature of the pipeline is to concatenate assets, which can reduce the
number of requests that a browser makes to render a web page. Web browsers are
limited in the number of requests that they can make in parallel, so fewer
requests can mean faster loading for your application.</p>

<p>Sprockets concatenates all JavaScript files into one master <code>.js</code> file and all
CSS files into one master <code>.css</code> file. As you'll learn later in this guide, you
can customize this strategy to group files any way you like. In production,
Rails inserts an SHA256 fingerprint into each filename so that the file is
cached by the web browser. You can invalidate the cache by altering this
fingerprint, which happens automatically whenever you change the file contents.</p>

<p>The second feature of the asset pipeline is asset minification or compression.
For CSS files, this is done by removing whitespace and comments. For JavaScript,
more complex processes can be applied. You can choose from a set of built in
options or specify your own.</p>

<p>The third feature of the asset pipeline is it allows coding assets via a
higher-level language, with precompilation down to the actual assets. Supported
languages include Sass for CSS, CoffeeScript for JavaScript, and ERB for both by
default.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark"><a class="anchorlink" href="#what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark">1.2 What is Fingerprinting and Why Should I Care?</a></h4>

<p>Fingerprinting is a technique that makes the name of a file dependent on the
contents of the file. When the file contents change, the filename is also
changed. For content that is static or infrequently changed, this provides an
easy way to tell whether two versions of a file are identical, even across
different servers or deployment dates.</p>

<p>When a filename is unique and based on its content, HTTP headers can be set to
encourage caches everywhere (whether at CDNs, at ISPs, in networking equipment,
or in web browsers) to keep their own copy of the content. When the content is
updated, the fingerprint will change. This will cause the remote clients to
request a new copy of the content. This is generally known as <em>cache busting</em>.</p>

<p>The technique Sprockets uses for fingerprinting is to insert a hash of the
content into the name, usually at the end. For example a CSS file <code>global.css</code></p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight plaintext">global-908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.css
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-3d0cf252d5dd6029c0776e100a8b4379">global-908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.css
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-3d0cf252d5dd6029c0776e100a8b4379">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>This is the strategy adopted by the Rails asset pipeline.</p>

<p>Rails' old strategy was to append a date-based query string to every asset linked
with a built-in helper. In the source the generated code looked like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight plaintext">/stylesheets/global.css?1309495796
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-edd5b1df5dcb1fd4a42cf35f344ef804">/stylesheets/global.css?1309495796
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-edd5b1df5dcb1fd4a42cf35f344ef804">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>The query string strategy has several disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Not all caches will reliably cache content where the filename only differs by
query parameters</strong>
<a href="https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/">Steve Souders recommends</a>,
"...avoiding a querystring for cacheable resources". He found that in this
case 5-20% of requests will not be cached. Query strings in particular do not
work at all with some CDNs for cache invalidation.
</li>
<li>
<strong>The file name can change between nodes in multi-server environments.</strong>
The default query string in Rails 2.x is based on the modification time of
the files. When assets are deployed to a cluster, there is no guarantee that the
timestamps will be the same, resulting in different values being used depending
on which server handles the request.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Too much cache invalidation</strong>
When static assets are deployed with each new release of code, the mtime
(time of last modification) of <em>all</em> these files changes, forcing all remote
clients to fetch them again, even when the content of those assets has not changed.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fingerprinting fixes these problems by avoiding query strings, and by ensuring
that filenames are consistent based on their content.</p>

<p>Fingerprinting is enabled by default for both the development and production
environments. You can enable or disable it in your configuration through the
<code>config.assets.digest</code> option.</p>
