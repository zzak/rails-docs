<p>There are some cases where you may want your application to connect to a writer or a replica
and the automatic connection switching isn't adequate. For example, you may know that for a
particular request you always want to send the request to a replica, even when you are in a
POST request path.</p>

<p>To do this Rails provides a <code>connected_to</code> method that will switch to the connection you
need.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">connected_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">role: :reading</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="c1"># all code in this block will be connected to the reading role</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-45592dab57133ee7cb2eb09e20ee516a">ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :reading) do
  # all code in this block will be connected to the reading role
end
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-45592dab57133ee7cb2eb09e20ee516a">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>The "role" in the <code>connected_to</code> call looks up the connections that are connected on that
connection handler (or role). The <code>reading</code> connection handler will hold all the connections
that were connected via <code>connects_to</code> with the role name of <code>reading</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>connected_to</code> with a role will look up an existing connection and switch
using the connection specification name. This means that if you pass an unknown role
like <code>connected_to(role: :nonexistent)</code> you will get an error that says
<code>ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished (No connection pool for 'ActiveRecord::Base' found for the 'nonexistent' role.)</code></p>
