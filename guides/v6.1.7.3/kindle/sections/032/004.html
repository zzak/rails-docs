<p>As you probably know, when <code>require</code> gets a relative file name:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s2">"erb"</span>
</code></pre>
<textarea class="clipboard-content" id="clipboard-658a7c441a38b600e0b6edf2c80aefb6">require "erb"
</textarea>
<button class="clipboard-button" data-clipboard-target="#clipboard-658a7c441a38b600e0b6edf2c80aefb6">Copy</button>
</div>
<p>Ruby looks for the file in the directories listed in <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>. That is, Ruby
iterates over all its directories and for each one of them checks whether they
have a file called "erb.rb", or "erb.so", or "erb.o", or "erb.dll". If it finds
any of them, the interpreter loads it and ends the search. Otherwise, it tries
again in the next directory of the list. If the list gets exhausted, <code>LoadError</code>
is raised.</p>

<p>We are going to cover how constant autoloading works in more detail later, but
the idea is that when a constant like <code>Post</code> is hit and missing, if there's a
<code>post.rb</code> file for example in <code>app/models</code> Rails is going to find it, evaluate
it, and have <code>Post</code> defined as a side-effect.</p>

<p>All right, Rails has a collection of directories similar to <code>$LOAD_PATH</code> in which
to look up <code>post.rb</code>. That collection is called <code>autoload_paths</code> and by
default it contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>All subdirectories of <code>app</code> in the application and engines present at boot
time. For example, <code>app/controllers</code>. They do not need to be the default
ones, any custom directories like <code>app/workers</code> belong automatically to
<code>autoload_paths</code>.</li>
<li>Any existing second level directories called <code>app/*/concerns</code> in the
application and engines.</li>
<li>The directory <code>test/mailers/previews</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>eager_load_paths</code> is initially the <code>app</code> paths above</p>

<p>How files are autoloaded depends on <code>eager_load</code> and <code>cache_classes</code> config settings which typically vary in development, production, and test modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>development</strong>, you want quicker startup with incremental loading of application code. So <code>eager_load</code> should be set to <code>false</code>, and Rails will autoload files as needed (see <a href="#autoloading-algorithms">Autoloading Algorithms</a> below) -- and then reload them when they change (see <a href="#constant-reloading">Constant Reloading</a> below).</li>
<li>In <strong>production</strong>, however, you want consistency and thread-safety and can live with a longer boot time. So <code>eager_load</code> is set to <code>true</code>, and then during boot (before the app is ready to receive requests) Rails loads all files in the <code>eager_load_paths</code> and then turns off auto loading (NB: autoloading may be needed during eager loading). Not autoloading after boot is a <code>good thing</code>, as autoloading can cause the app to have thread-safety problems.</li>
<li>In <strong>test</strong>, for speed of execution (of individual tests) <code>eager_load</code> is <code>false</code>, so Rails follows development behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is described above are the defaults with a newly generated Rails app.
There are multiple ways this can be configured differently (see <a href="configuring.html#rails-general-configuration">Configuring
Rails Applications</a>). In the past, before
Rails 5, developers might configure <code>autoload_paths</code> to add in extra locations
(e.g. <code>lib</code> which used to be an autoload path list years ago, but no longer
is). However this is now discouraged for most purposes, as it is likely to
lead to production-only errors. It is possible to add new locations to both
<code>config.eager_load_paths</code> and <code>config.autoload_paths</code> but use at your own risk.</p>

<p>See also <a href="#autoloading-in-the-test-environment">Autoloading in the Test Environment</a>.</p>

<p>The value of <code>autoload_paths</code> can be inspected. In a just-generated application
it is (edited):</p>
