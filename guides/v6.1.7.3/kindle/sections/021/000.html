<p>Action Cable seamlessly integrates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a> with the rest of your
Rails application. It allows for real-time features to be written in Ruby in the
same style and form as the rest of your Rails application, while still being
performant and scalable. It's a full-stack offering that provides both a
client-side JavaScript framework and a server-side Ruby framework. You have
access to your full domain model written with Active Record or your ORM of
choice.</p>
