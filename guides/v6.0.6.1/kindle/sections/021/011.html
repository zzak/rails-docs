<p class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-1-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> Or, to quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">Wikipedia</a>: <em>"Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text."</em></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-2"><a href="#footnote-2-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> Other backends might allow or require to use other formats, e.g. a GetText backend might allow to read GetText files.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-3"><a href="#footnote-3-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> One of these reasons is that we don't want to imply any unnecessary load for applications that do not need any I18n capabilities, so we need to keep the I18n library as simple as possible for English. Another reason is that it is virtually impossible to implement a one-fits-all solution for all problems related to I18n for all existing languages. So a solution that allows us to exchange the entire implementation easily is appropriate anyway. This also makes it much easier to experiment with custom features and extensions.</p>
