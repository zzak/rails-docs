<p>A single Action Cable server can handle multiple connection instances. It has one
connection instance per WebSocket connection. A single user may have multiple
WebSockets open to your application if they use multiple browser tabs or devices.
The client of a WebSocket connection is called the consumer.</p>

<p>Each consumer can in turn subscribe to multiple cable channels. Each channel
encapsulates a logical unit of work, similar to what a controller does in
a regular MVC setup. For example, you could have a <code>ChatChannel</code> and
an <code>AppearancesChannel</code>, and a consumer could be subscribed to either
or to both of these channels. At the very least, a consumer should be subscribed
to one channel.</p>

<p>When the consumer is subscribed to a channel, they act as a subscriber.
The connection between the subscriber and the channel is, surprise-surprise,
called a subscription. A consumer can act as a subscriber to a given channel
any number of times. For example, a consumer could subscribe to multiple chat rooms
at the same time. (And remember that a physical user may have multiple consumers,
one per tab/device open to your connection).</p>

<p>Each channel can then again be streaming zero or more broadcastings.
A broadcasting is a pubsub link where anything transmitted by the broadcaster is
sent directly to the channel subscribers who are streaming that named broadcasting.</p>

<p>As you can see, this is a fairly deep architectural stack. There's a lot of new
terminology to identify the new pieces, and on top of that, you're dealing
with both client and server side reflections of each unit.</p>
