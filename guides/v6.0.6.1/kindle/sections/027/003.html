<p>In the production environment Sprockets uses the fingerprinting scheme outlined
above. By default Rails assumes assets have been precompiled and will be
served as static assets by your web server.</p>

<p>During the precompilation phase an SHA256 is generated from the contents of the
compiled files, and inserted into the filenames as they are written to disk.
These fingerprinted names are used by the Rails helpers in place of the manifest
name.</p>

<p>For example this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "application" %&gt;
&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag "application" %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>generates something like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;script src="/assets/application-908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link href="/assets/application-4dd5b109ee3439da54f5bdfd78a80473.css" media="screen"
rel="stylesheet" /&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>with the Asset Pipeline the <code>:cache</code> and <code>:concat</code> options aren't used
anymore, delete these options from the <code>javascript_include_tag</code> and
<code>stylesheet_link_tag</code>.</p></div>

<p>The fingerprinting behavior is controlled by the <code>config.assets.digest</code>
initialization option (which defaults to <code>true</code>).</p>

<div class="note"><p>Under normal circumstances the default <code>config.assets.digest</code> option
should not be changed. If there are no digests in the filenames, and far-future
headers are set, remote clients will never know to refetch the files when their
content changes.</p></div>

<h4 id="precompiling-assets"><a class="anchorlink" href="#precompiling-assets">4.1 Precompiling Assets</a></h4>

<p>Rails comes bundled with a command to compile the asset manifests and other
files in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Compiled assets are written to the location specified in <code>config.assets.prefix</code>.
By default, this is the <code>/assets</code> directory.</p>

<p>You can call this command on the server during deployment to create compiled
versions of your assets directly on the server. See the next section for
information on compiling locally.</p>

<p>The command is:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ RAILS_ENV=production rails assets:precompile

</pre>
</div>
<p>Capistrano (v2.15.1 and above) includes a recipe to handle this in deployment.
Add the following line to <code>Capfile</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
load 'deploy/assets'

</pre>
</div>
<p>This links the folder specified in <code>config.assets.prefix</code> to <code>shared/assets</code>.
If you already use this shared folder you'll need to write your own deployment
command.</p>

<p>It is important that this folder is shared between deployments so that remotely
cached pages referencing the old compiled assets still work for the life of
the cached page.</p>

<p>The default matcher for compiling files includes <code>application.js</code>,
<code>application.css</code> and all non-JS/CSS files (this will include all image assets
automatically) from <code>app/assets</code> folders including your gems:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
[ Proc.new { |filename, path| path =~ /app\/assets/ &amp;&amp; !%w(.js .css).include?(File.extname(filename)) },
/application.(css|js)$/ ]

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>The matcher (and other members of the precompile array; see below) is
applied to final compiled file names. This means anything that compiles to
JS/CSS is excluded, as well as raw JS/CSS files; for example, <code>.coffee</code> and
<code>.scss</code> files are <strong>not</strong> automatically included as they compile to JS/CSS.</p></div>

<p>If you have other manifests or individual stylesheets and JavaScript files to
include, you can add them to the <code>precompile</code> array in <code>config/initializers/assets.rb</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( admin.js admin.css )

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>Always specify an expected compiled filename that ends with <code>.js</code> or <code>.css</code>,
even if you want to add Sass or CoffeeScript files to the precompile array.</p></div>

<p>The command also generates a <code>.sprockets-manifest-randomhex.json</code> (where <code>randomhex</code> is
a 16-byte random hex string) that contains a list with all your assets and their respective
fingerprints. This is used by the Rails helper methods to avoid handing the
mapping requests back to Sprockets. A typical manifest file looks like:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">

<p>The default location for the manifest is the root of the location specified in

<h5 id="far-future-expires-header"><a class="anchorlink" href="#far-future-expires-header">4.1.1 Far-future Expires Header</a></h5>

<p>Precompiled assets exist on the file system and are served directly by your web
server. They do not have far-future headers by default, so to get the benefit of
fingerprinting you'll have to update your server configuration to add those
headers.</p>

<p>For Apache:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# The Expires* directives requires the Apache module
# `mod_expires` to be enabled.
&lt;Location /assets/&gt;
  # Use of ETag is discouraged when Last-Modified is present
  Header unset ETag
  FileETag None
  # RFC says only cache for 1 year
  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
&lt;/Location&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>For NGINX:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
location ~ ^/assets/ {
  expires 1y;
  add_header Cache-Control public;

  add_header ETag "";
}

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="local-precompilation"><a class="anchorlink" href="#local-precompilation">4.2 Local Precompilation</a></h4>

<p>There are several reasons why you might want to precompile your assets locally.
Among them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not have write access to your production file system.</li>
<li>You may be deploying to more than one server, and want to avoid
duplication of work.</li>
<li>You may be doing frequent deploys that do not include asset changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Local compilation allows you to commit the compiled files into source control,
and deploy as normal.</p>

<p>There are three caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must not run the Capistrano deployment task that precompiles assets.</li>
<li>You must ensure any necessary compressors or minifiers are
available on your development system.</li>
<li>You must change the following application configuration setting:</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>config/environments/development.rb</code>, place the following line:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.assets.prefix = "/dev-assets"

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>prefix</code> change makes Sprockets use a different URL for serving assets in
development mode, and pass all requests to Sprockets. The prefix is still set to
<code>/assets</code> in the production environment. Without this change, the application
would serve the precompiled assets from <code>/assets</code> in development, and you would
not see any local changes until you compile assets again.</p>

<p>In practice, this will allow you to precompile locally, have those files in your
working tree, and commit those files to source control when needed.  Development
mode will work as expected.</p>

<h4 id="live-compilation"><a class="anchorlink" href="#live-compilation">4.3 Live Compilation</a></h4>

<p>In some circumstances you may wish to use live compilation. In this mode all
requests for assets in the pipeline are handled by Sprockets directly.</p>

<p>To enable this option set:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.assets.compile = true

</pre>
</div>
<p>On the first request the assets are compiled and cached as outlined in
development above, and the manifest names used in the helpers are altered to
include the SHA256 hash.</p>

<p>Sprockets also sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header to <code>max-age=31536000</code>. This
signals all caches between your server and the client browser that this content
(the file served) can be cached for 1 year. The effect of this is to reduce the
number of requests for this asset from your server; the asset has a good chance
of being in the local browser cache or some intermediate cache.</p>

<p>This mode uses more memory, performs more poorly than the default, and is not
recommended.</p>

<p>If you are deploying a production application to a system without any
pre-existing JavaScript runtimes, you may want to add one to your <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
group :production do
  gem 'mini_racer'
end

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="cdns"><a class="anchorlink" href="#cdns">4.4 CDNs</a></h4>

<p>CDN stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content Delivery
Network</a>, they are
primarily designed to cache assets all over the world so that when a browser
requests the asset, a cached copy will be geographically close to that browser.
If you are serving assets directly from your Rails server in production, the
best practice is to use a CDN in front of your application.</p>

<p>A common pattern for using a CDN is to set your production application as the
"origin" server. This means when a browser requests an asset from the CDN and
there is a cache miss, it will grab the file from your server on the fly and
then cache it. For example if you are running a Rails application on
<code>example.com</code> and have a CDN configured at <code>mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com</code>,
then when a request is made to <code>mycdnsubdomain.fictional-
cdn.com/assets/smile.png</code>, the CDN will query your server once at
<code>example.com/assets/smile.png</code> and cache the request. The next request to the
CDN that comes in to the same URL will hit the cached copy. When the CDN can
serve an asset directly the request never touches your Rails server. Since the
assets from a CDN are geographically closer to the browser, the request is
faster, and since your server doesn't need to spend time serving assets, it can
focus on serving application code as fast as possible.</p>

<h5 id="set-up-a-cdn-to-serve-static-assets"><a class="anchorlink" href="#set-up-a-cdn-to-serve-static-assets">4.4.1 Set up a CDN to Serve Static Assets</a></h5>

<p>To set up your CDN you have to have your application running in production on
the internet at a publicly available URL, for example <code>example.com</code>. Next
you'll need to sign up for a CDN service from a cloud hosting provider. When you
do this you need to configure the "origin" of the CDN to point back at your
website <code>example.com</code>, check your provider for documentation on configuring the
origin server.</p>

<p>The CDN you provisioned should give you a custom subdomain for your application
such as <code>mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com</code> (note fictional-cdn.com is not a
valid CDN provider at the time of this writing). Now that you have configured
your CDN server, you need to tell browsers to use your CDN to grab assets
instead of your Rails server directly. You can do this by configuring Rails to
set your CDN as the asset host instead of using a relative path. To set your
asset host in Rails, you need to set <code>config.action_controller.asset_host</code> in
<code>config/environments/production.rb</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.action_controller.asset_host = 'mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com'

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>You only need to provide the "host", this is the subdomain and root
domain, you do not need to specify a protocol or "scheme" such as <code>http://</code> or
<code>https://</code>. When a web page is requested, the protocol in the link to your asset
that is generated will match how the webpage is accessed by default.</p></div>

<p>You can also set this value through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">environment
variable</a> to make running a
staging copy of your site easier:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.action_controller.asset_host = ENV['CDN_HOST']

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>You would need to set <code>CDN_HOST</code> on your server to <code>mycdnsubdomain
.fictional-cdn.com</code> for this to work.</p></div>

<p>Once you have configured your server and your CDN when you serve a webpage that
has an asset:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= asset_path('smile.png') %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Instead of returning a path such as <code>/assets/smile.png</code> (digests are left out
for readability). The URL generated will have the full path to your CDN.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
http://mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com/assets/smile.png

</pre>
</div>
<p>If the CDN has a copy of <code>smile.png</code> it will serve it to the browser and your
server doesn't even know it was requested. If the CDN does not have a copy it
will try to find it at the "origin" <code>example.com/assets/smile.png</code> and then store
it for future use.</p>

<p>If you want to serve only some assets from your CDN, you can use custom <code>:host</code>
option your asset helper, which overwrites value set in
<code>config.action_controller.asset_host</code>.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= asset_path 'image.png', host: 'mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com' %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="customize-cdn-caching-behavior"><a class="anchorlink" href="#customize-cdn-caching-behavior">4.4.2 Customize CDN Caching Behavior</a></h5>

<p>A CDN works by caching content. If the CDN has stale or bad content, then it is
hurting rather than helping your application. The purpose of this section is to
describe general caching behavior of most CDNs, your specific provider may
behave slightly differently.</p>

<h6 id="cdn-request-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#cdn-request-caching">4.4.2.1 CDN Request Caching</a></h6>

<p>While a CDN is described as being good for caching assets, in reality caches the
entire request. This includes the body of the asset as well as any headers. The
most important one being <code>Cache-Control</code> which tells the CDN (and web browsers)
how to cache contents. This means that if someone requests an asset that does
not exist <code>/assets/i-dont-exist.png</code> and your Rails application returns a 404,
then your CDN will likely cache the 404 page if a valid <code>Cache-Control</code> header
is present.</p>

<h6 id="cdn-header-debugging"><a class="anchorlink" href="#cdn-header-debugging">4.4.2.2 CDN Header Debugging</a></h6>

<p>One way to check the headers are cached properly in your CDN is by using <a href="https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=curl+-I+http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com">curl</a>. You
can request the headers from both your server and your CDN to verify they are
the same:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">

<p>Check your CDN documentation for any additional information they may provide
such as <code>X-Cache</code> or for any additional headers they may add.</p>

<h6 id="cdns-and-the-cache-control-header"><a class="anchorlink" href="#cdns-and-the-cache-control-header">4.4.2.3 CDNs and the Cache-Control Header</a></h6>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9">cache control
header</a> is a W3C
specification that describes how a request can be cached. When no CDN is used, a
browser will use this information to cache contents. This is very helpful for
assets that are not modified so that a browser does not need to re-download a
website's CSS or JavaScript on every request. Generally we want our Rails server
to tell our CDN (and browser) that the asset is "public", that means any cache
can store the request. Also we commonly want to set <code>max-age</code> which is how long
the cache will store the object before invalidating the cache. The <code>max-age</code>
value is set to seconds with a maximum possible value of <code>31536000</code> which is one
year. You can do this in your Rails application by setting</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.public_file_server.headers = {
  'Cache-Control' =&gt; 'public, max-age=31536000'
}

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now when your application serves an asset in production, the CDN will store the
asset for up to a year. Since most CDNs also cache headers of the request, this
<code>Cache-Control</code> will be passed along to all future browsers seeking this asset,
the browser then knows that it can store this asset for a very long time before
needing to re-request it.</p>

<h6 id="cdns-and-url-based-cache-invalidation"><a class="anchorlink" href="#cdns-and-url-based-cache-invalidation">4.4.2.4 CDNs and URL based Cache Invalidation</a></h6>

<p>Most CDNs will cache contents of an asset based on the complete URL. This means
that a request to</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
http://mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com/assets/smile-123.png

</pre>
</div>
<p>Will be a completely different cache from</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
http://mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com/assets/smile.png

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you want to set far future <code>max-age</code> in your <code>Cache-Control</code> (and you do),
then make sure when you change your assets that your cache is invalidated. For
example when changing the smiley face in an image from yellow to blue, you want
all visitors of your site to get the new blue face. When using a CDN with the
Rails asset pipeline <code>config.assets.digest</code> is set to true by default so that
each asset will have a different file name when it is changed. This way you
don't have to ever manually invalidate any items in your cache. By using a
different unique asset name instead, your users get the latest asset.</p>
