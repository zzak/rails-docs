<h3 id="how-to-use-the-asset-pipeline"><a class="anchorlink" href="#how-to-use-the-asset-pipeline">2 How to Use the Asset Pipeline</a></h3>
<p>In previous versions of Rails, all assets were located in subdirectories of
<code>public</code> such as <code>images</code>, <code>javascripts</code> and <code>stylesheets</code>. With the asset
pipeline, the preferred location for these assets is now the <code>app/assets</code>
directory. Files in this directory are served by the Sprockets middleware.</p>

<p>Assets can still be placed in the <code>public</code> hierarchy. Any assets under <code>public</code>
will be served as static files by the application or web server when
<code>config.public_file_server.enabled</code> is set to true. You should use <code>app/assets</code> for
files that must undergo some pre-processing before they are served.</p>

<p>In production, Rails precompiles these files to <code>public/assets</code> by default. The
precompiled copies are then served as static assets by the web server. The files
in <code>app/assets</code> are never served directly in production.</p>

<h4 id="controller-specific-assets"><a class="anchorlink" href="#controller-specific-assets">2.1 Controller Specific Assets</a></h4>

<p>When you generate a scaffold or a controller, Rails also generates a
Cascading Style Sheet file (or SCSS file if <code>sass-rails</code> is in the <code>Gemfile</code>)
for that controller. Additionally, when generating a scaffold, Rails generates
the file <code>scaffolds.css</code> (or <code>scaffolds.scss</code> if <code>sass-rails</code> is in the
<code>Gemfile</code>.)</p>

<p>For example, if you generate a <code>ProjectsController</code>, Rails will also add a new
file at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/projects.scss</code>. By default these files will be
ready to use by your application immediately using the <code>require_tree</code> directive. See
<a href="#manifest-files-and-directives">Manifest Files and Directives</a> for more details
on require_tree.</p>

<p>You can also opt to include controller specific stylesheets and JavaScript files
only in their respective controllers using the following:</p>

<p><code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag params[:controller] %&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag
params[:controller] %&gt;</code></p>

<p>When doing this, ensure you are not using the <code>require_tree</code> directive, as that
will result in your assets being included more than once.</p>

<div class="warning"><p>When using asset precompilation, you will need to ensure that your
controller assets will be precompiled when loading them on a per page basis. By
default <code>.coffee</code> and <code>.scss</code> files will not be precompiled on their own. See
<a href="#precompiling-assets">Precompiling Assets</a> for more information on how
precompiling works.</p></div>

<div class="note"><p>You must have an ExecJS supported runtime in order to use CoffeeScript.
If you are using macOS or Windows, you have a JavaScript runtime installed in
your operating system. Check <a href="https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme">ExecJS</a> documentation to know all supported JavaScript runtimes.</p></div>

<p>You can also disable generation of controller specific asset files by adding the
following to your <code>config/application.rb</code> configuration:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
  config.generators do |g|
    g.assets false
  end

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="asset-organization"><a class="anchorlink" href="#asset-organization">2.2 Asset Organization</a></h4>

<p>Pipeline assets can be placed inside an application in one of three locations:
<code>app/assets</code>, <code>lib/assets</code> or <code>vendor/assets</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>app/assets</code> is for assets that are owned by the application, such as custom
images, JavaScript files, or stylesheets.</li>
<li>
<code>lib/assets</code> is for your own libraries' code that doesn't really fit into the
scope of the application or those libraries which are shared across applications.</li>
<li>
<code>vendor/assets</code> is for assets that are owned by outside entities, such as
code for JavaScript plugins and CSS frameworks. Keep in mind that third party
code with references to other files also processed by the asset Pipeline (images,
stylesheets, etc.), will need to be rewritten to use helpers like <code>asset_path</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="search-paths"><a class="anchorlink" href="#search-paths">2.2.1 Search Paths</a></h5>

<p>When a file is referenced from a manifest or a helper, Sprockets searches the
three default asset locations for it.</p>

<p>The default locations are: the <code>images</code>, <code>javascripts</code> and <code>stylesheets</code>
directories under the <code>app/assets</code> folder, but these subdirectories
are not special - any path under <code>assets/*</code> will be searched.</p>

<p>For example, these files:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
app/assets/javascripts/home.js
lib/assets/javascripts/moovinator.js
vendor/assets/javascripts/slider.js
vendor/assets/somepackage/phonebox.js

</pre>
</div>
<p>would be referenced in a manifest like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
//= require home
//= require moovinator
//= require slider
//= require phonebox

</pre>
</div>
<p>Assets inside subdirectories can also be accessed.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
app/assets/javascripts/sub/something.js

</pre>
</div>
<p>is referenced as:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
//= require sub/something

</pre>
</div>
<p>You can view the search path by inspecting
<code>Rails.application.config.assets.paths</code> in the Rails console.</p>

<p>Besides the standard <code>assets/*</code> paths, additional (fully qualified) paths can be
added to the pipeline in <code>config/initializers/assets.rb</code>. For example:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.config.assets.paths &lt;&lt; Rails.root.join("lib", "videoplayer", "flash")

</pre>
</div>
<p>Paths are traversed in the order they occur in the search path. By default,
this means the files in <code>app/assets</code> take precedence, and will mask
corresponding paths in <code>lib</code> and <code>vendor</code>.</p>

<p>It is important to note that files you want to reference outside a manifest must
be added to the precompile array or they will not be available in the production
environment.</p>

<h5 id="using-index-files"><a class="anchorlink" href="#using-index-files">2.2.2 Using Index Files</a></h5>

<p>Sprockets uses files named <code>index</code> (with the relevant extensions) for a special
purpose.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a jQuery library with many modules, which is stored in
<code>lib/assets/javascripts/library_name</code>, the file <code>lib/assets/javascripts/library_name/index.js</code> serves as
the manifest for all files in this library. This file could include a list of
all the required files in order, or a simple <code>require_tree</code> directive.</p>

<p>The library as a whole can be accessed in the application manifest like so:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
//= require library_name

</pre>
</div>
<p>This simplifies maintenance and keeps things clean by allowing related code to
be grouped before inclusion elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="coding-links-to-assets"><a class="anchorlink" href="#coding-links-to-assets">2.3 Coding Links to Assets</a></h4>

<p>Sprockets does not add any new methods to access your assets - you still use the
familiar <code>javascript_include_tag</code> and <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all" %&gt;
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "application" %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>If using the turbolinks gem, which is included by default in Rails, then
include the 'data-turbolinks-track' option which causes turbolinks to check if
an asset has been updated and if so loads it into the page:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" =&gt; "reload" %&gt;
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbolinks-track" =&gt; "reload" %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>In regular views you can access images in the <code>app/assets/images</code> directory
like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= image_tag "rails.png" %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Provided that the pipeline is enabled within your application (and not disabled
in the current environment context), this file is served by Sprockets. If a file
exists at <code>public/assets/rails.png</code> it is served by the web server.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a request for a file with an SHA256 hash such as
<code>public/assets/rails-f90d8a84c707a8dc923fca1ca1895ae8ed0a09237f6992015fef1e11be77c023.png</code>
is treated the same way. How these hashes are generated is covered in the <a href="#in-production">In
Production</a> section later on in this guide.</p>

<p>Sprockets will also look through the paths specified in <code>config.assets.paths</code>,
which includes the standard application paths and any paths added by Rails
engines.</p>

<p>Images can also be organized into subdirectories if required, and then can be
accessed by specifying the directory's name in the tag:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= image_tag "icons/rails.png" %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<div class="warning"><p>If you're precompiling your assets (see <a href="#in-production">In Production</a>
below), linking to an asset that does not exist will raise an exception in the
calling page. This includes linking to a blank string. As such, be careful using
<code>image_tag</code> and the other helpers with user-supplied data.</p></div>

<h5 id="css-and-erb"><a class="anchorlink" href="#css-and-erb">2.3.1 CSS and ERB</a></h5>

<p>The asset pipeline automatically evaluates ERB. This means if you add an
<code>erb</code> extension to a CSS asset (for example, <code>application.css.erb</code>), then
helpers like <code>asset_path</code> are available in your CSS rules:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
.class { background-image: url(&lt;%= asset_path 'image.png' %&gt;) }

</pre>
</div>
<p>This writes the path to the particular asset being referenced. In this example,
it would make sense to have an image in one of the asset load paths, such as
<code>app/assets/images/image.png</code>, which would be referenced here. If this image is
already available in <code>public/assets</code> as a fingerprinted file, then that path is
referenced.</p>

<p>If you want to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">data URI</a> -
a method of embedding the image data directly into the CSS file - you can use
the <code>asset_data_uri</code> helper.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
#logo { background: url(&lt;%= asset_data_uri 'logo.png' %&gt;) }

</pre>
</div>
<p>This inserts a correctly-formatted data URI into the CSS source.</p>

<p>Note that the closing tag cannot be of the style <code>-%&gt;</code>.</p>

<h5 id="css-and-sass"><a class="anchorlink" href="#css-and-sass">2.3.2 CSS and Sass</a></h5>

<p>When using the asset pipeline, paths to assets must be re-written and
<code>sass-rails</code> provides <code>-url</code> and <code>-path</code> helpers (hyphenated in Sass,
underscored in Ruby) for the following asset classes: image, font, video, audio,
JavaScript and stylesheet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>image-url("rails.png")</code> returns <code>url(/assets/rails.png)</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>image-path("rails.png")</code> returns <code>"/assets/rails.png"</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The more generic form can also be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>asset-url("rails.png")</code> returns <code>url(/assets/rails.png)</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>asset-path("rails.png")</code> returns <code>"/assets/rails.png"</code>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="javascript-coffeescript-and-erb"><a class="anchorlink" href="#javascript-coffeescript-and-erb">2.3.3 JavaScript/CoffeeScript and ERB</a></h5>

<p>If you add an <code>erb</code> extension to a JavaScript asset, making it something such as
<code>application.js.erb</code>, you can then use the <code>asset_path</code> helper in your
JavaScript code:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$('#logo').attr({ src: "&lt;%= asset_path('logo.png') %&gt;" });

</pre>
</div>
<p>This writes the path to the particular asset being referenced.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can use the <code>asset_path</code> helper in CoffeeScript files with <code>erb</code>
extension (e.g., <code>application.coffee.erb</code>):</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$('#logo').attr src: "&lt;%= asset_path('logo.png') %&gt;"

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="manifest-files-and-directives"><a class="anchorlink" href="#manifest-files-and-directives">2.4 Manifest Files and Directives</a></h4>

<p>Sprockets uses manifest files to determine which assets to include and serve.
These manifest files contain <em>directives</em> - instructions that tell Sprockets
which files to require in order to build a single CSS or JavaScript file. With
these directives, Sprockets loads the files specified, processes them if
necessary, concatenates them into one single file, and then compresses them
(based on value of <code>Rails.application.config.assets.js_compressor</code>). By serving
one file rather than many, the load time of pages can be greatly reduced because
the browser makes fewer requests. Compression also reduces file size, enabling
the browser to download them faster.</p>

<p>For example, with a <code>app/assets/javascripts/application.js</code> file containing the
following lines:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
// ...
//= require rails-ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .

</pre>
</div>
<p>In JavaScript files, Sprockets directives begin with <code>//=</code>. In the above case,
the file is using the <code>require</code> and the <code>require_tree</code> directives. The <code>require</code>
directive is used to tell Sprockets the files you wish to require. Here, you are
requiring the files <code>rails-ujs.js</code> and <code>turbolinks.js</code> that are available somewhere
in the search path for Sprockets. You need not supply the extensions explicitly.
Sprockets assumes you are requiring a <code>.js</code> file when done from within a <code>.js</code>
file.</p>

<p>The <code>require_tree</code> directive tells Sprockets to recursively include <em>all</em>
JavaScript files in the specified directory into the output. These paths must be
specified relative to the manifest file. You can also use the
<code>require_directory</code> directive which includes all JavaScript files only in the
directory specified, without recursion.</p>

<p>Directives are processed top to bottom, but the order in which files are
included by <code>require_tree</code> is unspecified. You should not rely on any particular
order among those. If you need to ensure some particular JavaScript ends up
above some other in the concatenated file, require the prerequisite file first
in the manifest. Note that the family of <code>require</code> directives prevents files
from being included twice in the output.</p>

<p>Rails also creates a default <code>app/assets/stylesheets/application.css</code> file
which contains these lines:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
/* ...
*= require_self
*= require_tree .
*/

</pre>
</div>
<p>Rails create <code>app/assets/stylesheets/application.css</code> regardless of whether the
--skip-sprockets option is used when creating a new Rails application. This is
so you can easily add asset pipelining later if you like.</p>

<p>The directives that work in JavaScript files also work in stylesheets
(though obviously including stylesheets rather than JavaScript files). The
<code>require_tree</code> directive in a CSS manifest works the same way as the JavaScript
one, requiring all stylesheets from the current directory.</p>

<p>In this example, <code>require_self</code> is used. This puts the CSS contained within the
file (if any) at the precise location of the <code>require_self</code> call.</p>

<div class="note"><p>If you want to use multiple Sass files, you should generally use the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import">Sass <code>@import</code> rule</a>
instead of these Sprockets directives. When using Sprockets directives, Sass files exist within
their own scope, making variables or mixins only available within the document they were defined in.</p></div>

<p>You can do file globbing as well using <code>@import "*"</code>, and <code>@import "**/*"</code> to add the whole tree which is equivalent to how <code>require_tree</code> works. Check the <a href="https://github.com/rails/sass-rails#features">sass-rails documentation</a> for more info and important caveats.</p>

<p>You can have as many manifest files as you need. For example, the <code>admin.css</code>
and <code>admin.js</code> manifest could contain the JS and CSS files that are used for the
admin section of an application.</p>

<p>The same remarks about ordering made above apply. In particular, you can specify
individual files and they are compiled in the order specified. For example, you
might concatenate three CSS files together this way:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
/* ...
*= require reset
*= require layout
*= require chrome
*/

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="preprocessing"><a class="anchorlink" href="#preprocessing">2.5 Preprocessing</a></h4>

<p>The file extensions used on an asset determine what preprocessing is applied.
When a controller or a scaffold is generated with the default Rails gemset, a
CoffeeScript file and a SCSS file are generated in place of a regular JavaScript
and CSS file. The example used before was a controller called "projects", which
generated an <code>app/assets/stylesheets/projects.scss</code> file.</p>

<p>In development mode, or if the asset pipeline is disabled, when these files are
requested they are processed by the processors provided by the <code>coffee-script</code>
and <code>sass</code> gems and then sent back to the browser as JavaScript and CSS
respectively. When asset pipelining is enabled, these files are preprocessed and
placed in the <code>public/assets</code> directory for serving by either the Rails app or
web server.</p>

<p>Additional layers of preprocessing can be requested by adding other extensions,
where each extension is processed in a right-to-left manner. These should be
used in the order the processing should be applied. For example, a stylesheet
called <code>app/assets/stylesheets/projects.scss.erb</code> is first processed as ERB,
then SCSS, and finally served as CSS. The same applies to a JavaScript file -
<code>app/assets/javascripts/projects.coffee.erb</code> is processed as ERB, then
CoffeeScript, and served as JavaScript.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the order of these preprocessors is important. For example, if
you called your JavaScript file <code>app/assets/javascripts/projects.erb.coffee</code>
then it would be processed with the CoffeeScript interpreter first, which
wouldn't understand ERB and therefore you would run into problems.</p>
