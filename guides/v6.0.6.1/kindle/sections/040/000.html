<p>Engines can be considered miniature applications that provide functionality to
their host applications. A Rails application is actually just a "supercharged"
engine, with the <code>Rails::Application</code> class inheriting a lot of its behavior
from <code>Rails::Engine</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore, engines and applications can be thought of as almost the same thing,
just with subtle differences, as you'll see throughout this guide. Engines and
applications also share a common structure.</p>

<p>Engines are also closely related to plugins. The two share a common <code>lib</code>
directory structure, and are both generated using the <code>rails plugin new</code>
generator. The difference is that an engine is considered a "full plugin" by
Rails (as indicated by the <code>--full</code> option that's passed to the generator
command). We'll actually be using the <code>--mountable</code> option here, which includes
all the features of <code>--full</code>, and then some. This guide will refer to these
"full plugins" simply as "engines" throughout. An engine <strong>can</strong> be a plugin,
and a plugin <strong>can</strong> be an engine.</p>

<p>The engine that will be created in this guide will be called "blorgh". This
engine will provide blogging functionality to its host applications, allowing
for new articles and comments to be created. At the beginning of this guide, you
will be working solely within the engine itself, but in later sections you'll
see how to hook it into an application.</p>

<p>Engines can also be isolated from their host applications. This means that an
application is able to have a path provided by a routing helper such as
<code>articles_path</code> and use an engine that also provides a path also called
<code>articles_path</code>, and the two would not clash. Along with this, controllers, models
and table names are also namespaced. You'll see how to do this later in this
guide.</p>

<p>It's important to keep in mind at all times that the application should
<strong>always</strong> take precedence over its engines. An application is the object that
has final say in what goes on in its environment. The engine should
only be enhancing it, rather than changing it drastically.</p>

<p>To see demonstrations of other engines, check out
<a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>, an engine that provides
authentication for its parent applications, or
<a href="https://github.com/thredded/thredded">Thredded</a>, an engine that provides forum
functionality. There's also <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree">Spree</a> which
provides an e-commerce platform, and
<a href="https://github.com/refinery/refinerycms">Refinery CMS</a>, a CMS engine.</p>

<p>Finally, engines would not have been possible without the work of James Adam,
Piotr Sarnacki, the Rails Core Team, and a number of other people. If you ever
meet them, don't forget to say thanks!</p>
