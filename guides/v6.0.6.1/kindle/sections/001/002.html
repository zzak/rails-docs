<p>The best way to read this guide is to follow it step by step. All steps are
essential to run this example application and no additional code or steps are
needed.</p>

<p>By following along with this guide, you'll create a Rails project called
<code>blog</code>, a (very) simple weblog. Before you can start building the application,
you need to make sure that you have Rails itself installed.</p>

<div class="info"><p>The examples below use <code>$</code> to represent your terminal prompt in a UNIX-like OS,
though it may have been customized to appear differently. If you are using Windows,
your prompt will look something like <code>c:\source_code&gt;</code></p></div>

<h4 id="creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails"><a class="anchorlink" href="#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails">3.1 Installing Rails</a></h4>

<p>Before you install Rails, you should check to make sure that your system has the
proper prerequisites installed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>SQLite3</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Yarn</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="installing-ruby"><a class="anchorlink" href="#installing-ruby">3.1.1 Installing Ruby</a></h5>

<p>Open up a command line prompt. On macOS open Terminal.app, on Windows choose
"Run" from your Start menu and type 'cmd.exe'. Any commands prefaced with a
dollar sign <code>$</code> should be run in the command line. Verify that you have a
current version of Ruby installed:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.5.0

</pre>
</div>
<p>Rails requires Ruby version 2.5.0 or later. If the version number returned is
less than that number, you'll need to install a fresh copy of Ruby.</p>

<p>To install Rails on Windows, you'll first need to install <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/">Ruby Installer</a>.</p>

<p>For more installation methods for most Operating Systems take a look at
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/">ruby-lang.org</a>.</p>

<h5 id="installing-sqlite3"><a class="anchorlink" href="#installing-sqlite3">3.1.2 Installing SQLite3</a></h5>

<p>You will also need an installation of the SQLite3 database.
Many popular UNIX-like OSes ship with an acceptable version of SQLite3.
Others can find installation instructions at the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite3 website</a>.</p>

<p>Verify that it is correctly installed and in your load <code>PATH</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ sqlite3 --version

</pre>
</div>
<p>The program should report its version.</p>

<h5 id="installing-node-js-and-yarn"><a class="anchorlink" href="#installing-node-js-and-yarn">3.1.3 Installing Node.js and Yarn</a></h5>

<p>Finally, you'll need Node.js and Yarn installed to manage your application's JavaScript.</p>

<p>Find the installation instructions at the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js website</a> and
verify it's installed correctly with the following command:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ node --version

</pre>
</div>
<p>The version of your Node.js runtime should be printed out. Make sure it's greater
than 8.16.0.</p>

<p>To install Yarn, follow the installation
instructions at the <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">Yarn website</a>.</p>

<p>Running this command should print out Yarn version:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ yarn -v

</pre>
</div>
<p>If it says something like "1.22.0", Yarn has been installed correctly.</p>

<h5 id="creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails-installing-rails"><a class="anchorlink" href="#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails-installing-rails">3.1.4 Installing Rails</a></h5>

<p>To install Rails, use the <code>gem install</code> command provided by RubyGems:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ gem install rails

</pre>
</div>
<p>To verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to
run the following:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ rails --version

</pre>
</div>
<p>If it says something like "Rails 6.0.0", you are ready to continue.</p>

<h4 id="creating-the-blog-application"><a class="anchorlink" href="#creating-the-blog-application">3.2 Creating the Blog Application</a></h4>

<p>Rails comes with a number of scripts called generators that are designed to make
your development life easier by creating everything that's necessary to start
working on a particular task. One of these is the new application generator,
which will provide you with the foundation of a fresh Rails application so that
you don't have to write it yourself.</p>

<p>To use this generator, open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you have
rights to create files, and type:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ rails new blog

</pre>
</div>
<p>This will create a Rails application called Blog in a <code>blog</code> directory and
install the gem dependencies that are already mentioned in <code>Gemfile</code> using
<code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<div class="note"><p>If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux then there are currently some
limitations on file system notifications that mean you should disable the <code>spring</code>
and <code>listen</code> gems which you can do by running <code>rails new blog --skip-spring --skip-listen</code>.</p></div>

<div class="info"><p>You can see all of the command line options that the Rails application
builder accepts by running <code>rails new -h</code>.</p></div>

<p>After you create the blog application, switch to its folder:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd blog

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>blog</code> directory has a number of auto-generated files and folders that make
up the structure of a Rails application. Most of the work in this tutorial will
happen in the <code>app</code> folder, but here's a basic rundown on the function of each
of the files and folders that Rails created by default:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>File/Folder</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>app/</td>
<td>Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers, channels, jobs, and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bin/</td>
<td>Contains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to setup, update, deploy, or run your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>config/</td>
<td>Configure your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in <a href="configuring.html">Configuring Rails Applications</a>.</td>

<td>Rack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application. For more information about Rack, see the <a href="https://rack.github.io/">Rack website</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>db/</td>
<td>Contains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gemfile<br>Gemfile.lock</td>
<td>These files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see the <a href="https://bundler.io">Bundler website</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>lib/</td>
<td>Extended modules for your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>log/</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>public/</td>
<td>The only folder seen by the world as-is. Contains static files and compiled assets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>README.md</td>
<td>This is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.</td>
