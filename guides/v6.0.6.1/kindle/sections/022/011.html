<p>Testing mailer classes requires some specific tools to do a thorough job.</p>

<h4 id="keeping-the-postman-in-check"><a class="anchorlink" href="#keeping-the-postman-in-check">12.1 Keeping the Postman in Check</a></h4>

<p>Your mailer classes - like every other part of your Rails application - should be tested to ensure that they are working as expected.</p>

<p>The goals of testing your mailer classes are to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>emails are being processed (created and sent)</li>
<li>the email content is correct (subject, sender, body, etc)</li>
<li>the right emails are being sent at the right times</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="from-all-sides"><a class="anchorlink" href="#from-all-sides">12.1.1 From All Sides</a></h5>

<p>There are two aspects of testing your mailer, the unit tests and the functional tests. In the unit tests, you run the mailer in isolation with tightly controlled inputs and compare the output to a known value (a fixture.) In the functional tests you don't so much test the minute details produced by the mailer; instead, we test that our controllers and models are using the mailer in the right way. You test to prove that the right email was sent at the right time.</p>

<h4 id="unit-testing"><a class="anchorlink" href="#unit-testing">12.2 Unit Testing</a></h4>

<p>In order to test that your mailer is working as expected, you can use unit tests to compare the actual results of the mailer with pre-written examples of what should be produced.</p>

<h5 id="revenge-of-the-fixtures"><a class="anchorlink" href="#revenge-of-the-fixtures">12.2.1 Revenge of the Fixtures</a></h5>

<p>For the purposes of unit testing a mailer, fixtures are used to provide an example of how the output <em>should</em> look. Because these are example emails, and not Active Record data like the other fixtures, they are kept in their own subdirectory apart from the other fixtures. The name of the directory within <code>test/fixtures</code> directly corresponds to the name of the mailer. So, for a mailer named <code>UserMailer</code>, the fixtures should reside in <code>test/fixtures/user_mailer</code> directory.</p>

<p>If you generated your mailer, the generator does not create stub fixtures for the mailers actions. You'll have to create those files yourself as described above.</p>

<h5 id="the-basic-test-case"><a class="anchorlink" href="#the-basic-test-case">12.2.2 The Basic Test Case</a></h5>

<p>Here's a unit test to test a mailer named <code>UserMailer</code> whose action <code>invite</code> is used to send an invitation to a friend. It is an adapted version of the base test created by the generator for an <code>invite</code> action.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'test_helper'

class UserMailerTest &lt; ActionMailer::TestCase
  test "invite" do
    # Create the email and store it for further assertions
    email = UserMailer.create_invite('me@example.com',
                                     'friend@example.com', Time.now)

    # Send the email, then test that it got queued
    assert_emails 1 do
      email.deliver_now
    end

    # Test the body of the sent email contains what we expect it to
    assert_equal ['me@example.com'], email.from
    assert_equal ['friend@example.com'], email.to
    assert_equal 'You have been invited by me@example.com', email.subject
    assert_equal read_fixture('invite').join, email.body.to_s
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>In the test we create the email and store the returned object in the <code>email</code>
variable. We then ensure that it was sent (the first assert), then, in the
second batch of assertions, we ensure that the email does indeed contain what we
expect. The helper <code>read_fixture</code> is used to read in the content from this file.</p>

<div class="note"><p><code>email.body.to_s</code> is present when there's only one (HTML or text) part present.
If the mailer provides both, you can test your fixture against specific parts
with <code>email.text_part.body.to_s</code> or <code>email.html_part.body.to_s</code>.</p></div>

<p>Here's the content of the <code>invite</code> fixture:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Hi friend@example.com,

You have been invited.

Cheers!

</pre>
</div>
<p>This is the right time to understand a little more about writing tests for your
mailers. The line <code>ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :test</code> in
<code>config/environments/test.rb</code> sets the delivery method to test mode so that
email will not actually be delivered (useful to avoid spamming your users while
testing) but instead it will be appended to an array
(<code>ActionMailer::Base.deliveries</code>).</p>

<div class="note"><p>The <code>ActionMailer::Base.deliveries</code> array is only reset automatically in
<code>ActionMailer::TestCase</code> and <code>ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest</code> tests.
If you want to have a clean slate outside these test cases, you can reset it
manually with: <code>ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.clear</code></p></div>

<h4 id="functional-and-system-testing"><a class="anchorlink" href="#functional-and-system-testing">12.3 Functional and System Testing</a></h4>

<p>Unit testing allows us to test the attributes of the email while functional and system testing allows us to test whether user interactions appropriately trigger the email to be delivered. For example, you can check that the invite friend operation is sending an email appropriately:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# Integration Test
require 'test_helper'

class UsersControllerTest &lt; ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "invite friend" do
    # Asserts the difference in the ActionMailer::Base.deliveries
    assert_emails 1 do
      post invite_friend_url, params: { email: 'friend@example.com' }
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# System Test
require 'test_helper'

class UsersTest &lt; ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome

  test "inviting a friend" do
    visit invite_users_url
    fill_in 'Email', with: 'friend@example.com'
    assert_emails 1 do
      click_on 'Invite'
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>The <code>assert_emails</code> method is not tied to a particular deliver method and will work with emails delivered with either the <code>deliver_now</code> or <code>deliver_later</code> method. If we explicitly want to assert that the email has been enqueued we can use the <code>assert_enqueued_emails</code> method. More information can be found in the  <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.6.1/classes/ActionMailer/TestHelper.html">documentation here</a>.</p></div>
