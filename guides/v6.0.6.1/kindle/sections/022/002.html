<p>Parallel testing allows you to parallelize your test suite. While forking processes is the
default method, threading is supported as well. Running tests in parallel reduces the time it
takes your entire test suite to run.</p>

<h4 id="parallel-testing-with-processes"><a class="anchorlink" href="#parallel-testing-with-processes">3.1 Parallel testing with processes</a></h4>

<p>The default parallelization method is to fork processes using Ruby's DRb system. The processes
are forked based on the number of workers provided. The default number is the actual core count
on the machine you are on, but can be changed by the number passed to the parallelize method.</p>

<p>To enable parallelization add the following to your <code>test_helper.rb</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize(workers: 2)
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The number of workers passed is the number of times the process will be forked. You may want to
parallelize your local test suite differently from your CI, so an environment variable is provided
to be able to easily change the number of workers a test run should use:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
PARALLEL_WORKERS=15 rails test

</pre>
</div>
<p>When parallelizing tests, Active Record automatically handles creating a database and loading the schema into the database for each
process. The databases will be suffixed with the number corresponding to the worker. For example, if you
have 2 workers the tests will create <code>test-database-0</code> and <code>test-database-1</code> respectively.</p>

<p>If the number of workers passed is 1 or fewer the processes will not be forked and the tests will not
be parallelized and the tests will use the original <code>test-database</code> database.</p>

<p>Two hooks are provided, one runs when the process is forked, and one runs before the forked process is closed.
These can be useful if your app uses multiple databases or perform other tasks that depend on the number of
workers.</p>

<p>The <code>parallelize_setup</code> method is called right after the processes are forked. The <code>parallelize_teardown</code> method
is called right before the processes are closed.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize_setup do |worker|
    # setup databases
  end

  parallelize_teardown do |worker|
    # cleanup databases
  end

  parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>These methods are not needed or available when using parallel testing with threads.</p>

<h4 id="parallel-testing-with-threads"><a class="anchorlink" href="#parallel-testing-with-threads">3.2 Parallel testing with threads</a></h4>

<p>If you prefer using threads or are using JRuby, a threaded parallelization option is provided. The threaded
parallelizer is backed by Minitest's <code>Parallel::Executor</code>.</p>

<p>To change the parallelization method to use threads over forks put the following in your <code>test_helper.rb</code></p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors, with: :threads)
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Rails applications generated from JRuby will automatically include the <code>with: :threads</code> option.</p>

<p>The number of workers passed to <code>parallelize</code> determines the number of threads the tests will use. You may
want to parallelize your local test suite differently from your CI, so an environment variable is provided
to be able to easily change the number of workers a test run should use:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
PARALLEL_WORKERS=15 rails test

</pre>
