<p>Only the latest release series will receive bug fixes. When enough bugs are
fixed and its deemed worthy to release a new gem, this is the branch it happens
from.</p>

<p>In special situations, where someone from the Core Team agrees to support more series,
they are included in the list of supported series.</p>

<p><strong>Currently included series:</strong> <code>6.0.Z</code>.</p>
