<p>The Active Record way claims that intelligence belongs in your models, not in
the database. As such, features such as triggers or constraints,
which push some of that intelligence back into the database, are not heavily
used.</p>

<p>Validations such as <code>validates :foreign_key, uniqueness: true</code> are one way in
which models can enforce data integrity. The <code>:dependent</code> option on
associations allows models to automatically destroy child objects when the
parent is destroyed. Like anything which operates at the application level,
these cannot guarantee referential integrity and so some people augment them
with <a href="#foreign-keys">foreign key constraints</a> in the database.</p>

<p>Although Active Record does not provide all the tools for working directly with
such features, the <code>execute</code> method can be used to execute arbitrary SQL.</p>
