<h4 id="what-are-schema-files-for-questionmark"><a class="anchorlink" href="#what-are-schema-files-for-questionmark">6.1 What are Schema Files for?</a></h4>

<p>Migrations, mighty as they may be, are not the authoritative source for your
database schema. Your database remains the authoritative source. By default,
Rails generates <code>db/schema.rb</code> which attempts to capture the current state of
your database schema.</p>

<p>It tends to be faster and less error prone to create a new instance of your
application's database by loading the schema file via <code>rails db:schema:load</code>
than it is to replay the entire migration history.
<a href="#old-migrations">Old migrations</a> may fail to apply correctly if those
migrations use changing external dependencies or rely on application code which
evolves separately from your migrations.</p>

<p>Schema files are also useful if you want a quick look at what attributes an
Active Record object has. This information is not in the model's code and is
frequently spread across several migrations, but the information is nicely
summed up in the schema file.</p>

<h4 id="types-of-schema-dumps"><a class="anchorlink" href="#types-of-schema-dumps">6.2 Types of Schema Dumps</a></h4>

<p>The format of the schema dump generated by Rails is controlled by the
<code>config.active_record.schema_format</code> setting in <code>config/application.rb</code>. By
default, the format is <code>:ruby</code>, but can also be set to <code>:sql</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>:ruby</code> is selected, then the schema is stored in <code>db/schema.rb</code>. If you look
at this file you'll find that it looks an awful lot like one very big migration:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 2008_09_06_171750) do
  create_table "authors", force: true do |t|
    t.string   "name"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
  end

  create_table "products", force: true do |t|
    t.string   "name"
    t.text     "description"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
    t.string   "part_number"
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>In many ways this is exactly what it is. This file is created by inspecting the
database and expressing its structure using <code>create_table</code>, <code>add_index</code>, and so
on.</p>

<p><code>db/schema.rb</code> cannot express everything your database may support such as
triggers, sequences, stored procedures, check constraints, etc. While migrations
may use <code>execute</code> to create database constructs that are not supported by the
Ruby migration DSL, these constructs may not be able to be reconstituted by the
schema dumper. If you are using features like these, you should set the schema
format to <code>:sql</code> in order to get an accurate schema file that is useful to
create new database instances.</p>

<p>When the schema format is set to <code>:sql</code>, the database structure will be dumped
using a tool specific to the database into <code>db/structure.sql</code>. For example, for
PostgreSQL, the <code>pg_dump</code> utility is used. For MySQL and MariaDB, this file will
contain the output of <code>SHOW CREATE TABLE</code> for the various tables.</p>

<p>To load the schema from <code>db/structure.sql</code>, run <code>rails db:structure:load</code>.
Loading this file is done by executing the SQL statements it contains. By
definition, this will create a perfect copy of the database's structure.</p>

<h4 id="schema-dumps-and-source-control"><a class="anchorlink" href="#schema-dumps-and-source-control">6.3 Schema Dumps and Source Control</a></h4>

<p>Because schema files are commonly used to create new databases, it is strongly
recommended that you check your schema file into source control.</p>

<p>Merge conflicts can occur in your schema file when two branches modify schema.
To resolve these conflicts run <code>rails db:migrate</code> to regenerate the schema file.</p>
