<p>By default, an InboundEmail that has been successfully processed will be
incinerated after 30 days. This ensures you're not holding on to people's data
willy-nilly after they may have canceled their accounts or deleted their
content. The intention is that after you've processed an email, you should have
extracted all the data you needed and turned it into domain models and content
on your side of the application. The InboundEmail simply stays in the system
for the extra time to provide debugging and forensics options.</p>

<p>The actual incineration is done via the <code>IncinerationJob</code> that's scheduled
to run after <code>config.action_mailbox.incinerate_after</code> time. This value is
by default set to <code>30.days</code>, but you can change it in your production.rb
configuration. (Note that this far-future incineration scheduling relies on
your job queue being able to hold jobs for that long.)</p>
