<p>Action Mailbox routes incoming emails to controller-like mailboxes for
processing in Rails. It ships with ingresses for Mailgun, Mandrill, Postmark,
and SendGrid. You can also handle inbound mails directly via the built-in Exim,
Postfix, and Qmail ingresses.</p>

<p>The inbound emails are turned into <code>InboundEmail</code> records using Active Record
and feature lifecycle tracking, storage of the original email on cloud storage
via Active Storage, and responsible data handling with
on-by-default incineration.</p>

<p>These inbound emails are routed asynchronously using Active Job to one or
several dedicated mailboxes, which are capable of interacting directly
with the rest of your domain model.</p>
