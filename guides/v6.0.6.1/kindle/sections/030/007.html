<h3 id="single-table-inheritance"><a class="anchorlink" href="#single-table-inheritance">8 Single Table Inheritance</a></h3>
<p>Single Table Inheritance is a feature that doesn't play well with lazy loading. Reason is, its API generally needs to be able to enumerate the STI hierarchy to work correctly, whereas lazy loading defers loading classes until they are referenced. You can't enumerate what you haven't referenced yet.</p>

<p>In a sense, applications need to eager load STI hierarchies regardless of the loading mode.</p>

<p>Of course, if the application eager loads on boot, that is already accomplished. When it does not, it is in practice enough to instantiate the existing types in the database, which in development or test modes is usually fine. One way to do that is to throw this module into the <code>lib</code> directory:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module StiPreload
  unless Rails.application.config.eager_load
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    included do
      cattr_accessor :preloaded, instance_accessor: false
    end

    class_methods do
      def descendants
        preload_sti unless preloaded
        super
      end

      # Constantizes all types present in the database. There might be more on
      # disk, but that does not matter in practice as far as the STI API is
      # concerned.
      #
      # Assumes store_full_sti_class is true, the default.
      def preload_sti
        types_in_db = \
          base_class.
            unscoped.
            select(inheritance_column).
            distinct.
            pluck(inheritance_column).
            compact

        types_in_db.each do |type|
          logger.debug("Preloading STI type #{type}")
          type.constantize
        end

        self.preloaded = true
      end
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>and then include it in the STI root classes of your project:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/models/shape.rb
require "sti_preload"

class Shape &lt; ApplicationRecord
  include StiPreload # Only in the root class.
end

# app/models/polygon.rb
class Polygon &lt; Shape
end

# app/models/triangle.rb
class Triangle &lt; Polygon
end

</pre>
</div>
</body>
</html>
