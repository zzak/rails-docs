<p>Rails automatically allows various operations to be performed at the same time.</p>

<p>When using a threaded web server, such as the default Puma, multiple HTTP
requests will be served simultaneously, with each request provided its own
controller instance.</p>

<p>Threaded Active Job adapters, including the built-in Async, will likewise
execute several jobs at the same time. Action Cable channels are managed this
way too.</p>

<p>These mechanisms all involve multiple threads, each managing work for a unique
instance of some object (controller, job, channel), while sharing the global
process space (such as classes and their configurations, and global variables).
As long as your code doesn't modify any of those shared things, it can mostly
ignore that other threads exist.</p>

<p>The rest of this guide describes the mechanisms Rails uses to make it "mostly
ignorable", and how extensions and applications with special needs can use them.</p>
