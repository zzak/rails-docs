<p>Active Storage facilitates uploading files to a cloud storage service like
Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Storage and attaching those
files to Active Record objects. It comes with a local disk-based service for
development and testing and supports mirroring files to subordinate services for
backups and migrations.</p>

<p>Using Active Storage, an application can transform image uploads with
<a href="https://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>, generate image representations of
non-image uploads like PDFs and videos, and extract metadata from arbitrary
files.</p>
