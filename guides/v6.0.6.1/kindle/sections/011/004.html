<p>A common task is uploading some sort of file, whether it's a picture of a person or a CSV file containing data to process. The most important thing to remember with file uploads is that the rendered form's enctype attribute <strong>must</strong> be set to "multipart/form-data". If you use <code>form_with</code> with <code>:model</code>, this is done automatically. If you use <code>form_with</code> without <code>:model</code>, you must set it yourself, as per the following example.</p>

<p>The following two forms both upload a file.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= form_with(url: {action: :upload}, multipart: true) do %&gt;
  &lt;%= file_field_tag 'picture' %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;%= form_with model: @person do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.file_field :picture %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Rails provides the usual pair of helpers: the barebones <code>file_field_tag</code> and the model oriented <code>file_field</code>. As you would expect in the first case the uploaded file is in <code>params[:picture]</code> and in the second case in <code>params[:person][:picture]</code>.</p>

<h4 id="what-gets-uploaded"><a class="anchorlink" href="#what-gets-uploaded">5.1 What Gets Uploaded</a></h4>

<p>The object in the <code>params</code> hash is an instance of <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.6.1/classes/ActionDispatch/Http/UploadedFile.html"><code>ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile</code></a>. The following snippet saves the uploaded file in <code>#{Rails.root}/public/uploads</code> under the same name as the original file.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
def upload
  uploaded_file = params[:picture]
  File.open(Rails.root.join('public', 'uploads', uploaded_file.original_filename), 'wb') do |file|
    file.write(uploaded_file.read)
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Once a file has been uploaded, there are a multitude of potential tasks, ranging from where to store the files (on Disk, Amazon S3, etc), associating them with models, resizing image files, and generating thumbnails, etc. <a href="active_storage_overview.html">Active Storage</a> is designed to assist with these tasks.</p>
