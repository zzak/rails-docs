<p>It can also be useful to save information to log files at runtime. Rails maintains a separate log file for each runtime environment.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-logger-questionmark"><a class="anchorlink" href="#what-is-the-logger-questionmark">2.1 What is the Logger?</a></h4>

<p>Rails makes use of the <code>ActiveSupport::Logger</code> class to write log information. Other loggers, such as <code>Log4r</code>, may also be substituted.</p>

<p>You can specify an alternative logger in <code>config/application.rb</code> or any other environment file, for example:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
config.logger = Log4r::Logger.new("Application Log")

</pre>
</div>
<p>Or in the <code>Initializer</code> section, add <em>any</em> of the following</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
Rails.logger = Log4r::Logger.new("Application Log")

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p>By default, each log is created under <code>Rails.root/log/</code> and the log file is named after the environment in which the application is running.</p></div>

<h4 id="log-levels"><a class="anchorlink" href="#log-levels">2.2 Log Levels</a></h4>

<p>When something is logged, it's printed into the corresponding log if the log
level of the message is equal to or higher than the configured log level. If you
want to know the current log level, you can call the <code>Rails.logger.level</code>
method.</p>

<p>The available log levels are: <code>:debug</code>, <code>:info</code>, <code>:warn</code>, <code>:error</code>, <code>:fatal</code>,
and <code>:unknown</code>, corresponding to the log level numbers from 0 up to 5,
respectively. To change the default log level, use</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.log_level = :warn # In any environment initializer, or
Rails.logger.level = 0 # at any time

</pre>
</div>
<p>This is useful when you want to log under development or staging without flooding your production log with unnecessary information.</p>

<div class="info"><p>The default Rails log level is <code>debug</code> in all environments.</p></div>

<h4 id="sending-messages"><a class="anchorlink" href="#sending-messages">2.3 Sending Messages</a></h4>

<p>To write in the current log use the <code>logger.(debug|info|warn|error|fatal|unknown)</code> method from within a controller, model, or mailer:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
logger.debug "Person attributes hash: #{@person.attributes.inspect}"
logger.info "Processing the request..."
logger.fatal "Terminating application, raised unrecoverable error!!!"

</pre>
</div>
<p>Here's an example of a method instrumented with extra logging:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController
  # ...

  def create
    @article = Article.new(article_params)
    logger.debug "New article: #{@article.attributes.inspect}"
    logger.debug "Article should be valid: #{@article.valid?}"

    if @article.save
      logger.debug "The article was saved and now the user is going to be redirected..."
      redirect_to @article, notice: 'Article was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  # ...

  private
    def article_params
      params.require(:article).permit(:title, :body, :published)
    end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Here's an example of the log generated when this controller action is executed:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">

</div>
<p>Adding extra logging like this makes it easy to search for unexpected or unusual behavior in your logs. If you add extra logging, be sure to make sensible use of log levels to avoid filling your production logs with useless trivia.</p>

<h4 id="verbose-query-logs"><a class="anchorlink" href="#verbose-query-logs">2.4 Verbose Query Logs</a></h4>

<p>When looking at database query output in logs, it may not be immediately clear why multiple database queries are triggered when a single method is called:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
irb(main):001:0&gt; Article.pamplemousse
  Article Load (0.4ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles"
  Comment Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 1]]
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 2]]
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 3]]
=&gt; #&lt;Comment id: 2, author: "1", body: "Well, actually...", article_id: 1, created_at: "2018-10-19 00:56:10", updated_at: "2018-10-19 00:56:10"&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>After running <code>ActiveRecord::Base.verbose_query_logs = true</code> in the <code>rails console</code> session to enable verbose query logs and running the method again, it becomes obvious what single line of code is generating all these discrete database calls:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
irb(main):003:0&gt; Article.pamplemousse
  Article Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "articles".* FROM "articles"
  ↳ app/models/article.rb:5
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 1]]
  ↳ app/models/article.rb:6
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 2]]
  ↳ app/models/article.rb:6
  Comment Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "comments".* FROM "comments" WHERE "comments"."article_id" = ?  [["article_id", 3]]
  ↳ app/models/article.rb:6
=&gt; #&lt;Comment id: 2, author: "1", body: "Well, actually...", article_id: 1, created_at: "2018-10-19 00:56:10", updated_at: "2018-10-19 00:56:10"&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Below each database statement you can see arrows pointing to the specific source filename (and line number) of the method that resulted in a database call. This can help you identify and address performance problems caused by N+1 queries: single database queries that generates multiple additional queries.</p>

<p>Verbose query logs are enabled by default in the development environment logs after Rails 5.2.</p>

<div class="warning"><p>We recommend against using this setting in production environments. It relies on Ruby's <code>Kernel#caller</code> method which tends to allocate a lot of memory in order to generate stacktraces of method calls.</p></div>

<h4 id="tagged-logging"><a class="anchorlink" href="#tagged-logging">2.5 Tagged Logging</a></h4>

<p>When running multi-user, multi-account applications, it's often useful
to be able to filter the logs using some custom rules. <code>TaggedLogging</code>
in Active Support helps you do exactly that by stamping log lines with subdomains, request ids, and anything else to aid debugging such applications.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(Logger.new(STDOUT))
logger.tagged("BCX") { logger.info "Stuff" }                            # Logs "[BCX] Stuff"
logger.tagged("BCX", "Jason") { logger.info "Stuff" }                   # Logs "[BCX] [Jason] Stuff"
logger.tagged("BCX") { logger.tagged("Jason") { logger.info "Stuff" } } # Logs "[BCX] [Jason] Stuff"

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="impact-of-logs-on-performance"><a class="anchorlink" href="#impact-of-logs-on-performance">2.6 Impact of Logs on Performance</a></h4>

<p>Logging will always have a small impact on the performance of your Rails app,
particularly when logging to disk. Additionally, there are a few subtleties:</p>

<p>Using the <code>:debug</code> level will have a greater performance penalty than <code>:fatal</code>,
as a far greater number of strings are being evaluated and written to the
log output (e.g. disk).</p>

<p>Another potential pitfall is too many calls to <code>Logger</code> in your code:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
logger.debug "Person attributes hash: #{@person.attributes.inspect}"

</pre>
</div>
<p>In the above example, there will be a performance impact even if the allowed
output level doesn't include debug. The reason is that Ruby has to evaluate
these strings, which includes instantiating the somewhat heavy <code>String</code> object
and interpolating the variables.</p>

<p>Therefore, it's recommended to pass blocks to the logger methods, as these are
only evaluated if the output level is the same as — or included in — the allowed level
(i.e. lazy loading). The same code rewritten would be:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
logger.debug {"Person attributes hash: #{@person.attributes.inspect}"}

</pre>
</div>
<p>The contents of the block, and therefore the string interpolation, are only
evaluated if debug is enabled. This performance savings are only really
noticeable with large amounts of logging, but it's a good practice to employ.</p>
