<p>Finally, in order to use the read-only replica in your application you'll need to activate
the middleware for automatic switching.</p>

<p>Automatic switching allows the application to switch from the primary to replica or replica
to primary based on the HTTP verb and whether there was a recent write.</p>

<p>If the application is receiving a POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH request the application will
automatically write to the primary. For the specified time after the write the application
will read from the primary. For a GET or HEAD request the application will read from the
replica unless there was a recent write.</p>

<p>To activate the automatic connection switching middleware, add or uncomment the following
lines in your application config.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.active_record.database_selector = { delay: 2.seconds }
config.active_record.database_resolver = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver
config.active_record.database_resolver_context = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver::Session

</pre>
</div>
<p>Rails guarantees "read your own write" and will send your GET or HEAD request to the
primary if it's within the <code>delay</code> window. By default the delay is set to 2 seconds. You
should change this based on your database infrastructure. Rails doesn't guarantee "read
a recent write" for other users within the delay window and will send GET and HEAD requests
to the replicas unless they wrote recently.</p>

<p>The automatic connection switching in Rails is relatively primitive and deliberately doesn't
do a whole lot. The goal was a system that demonstrated how to do automatic connection
switching that was flexible enough to be customizable by app developers.</p>

<p>The setup in Rails allows you to easily change how the switching is done and what
parameters it's based on. Let's say you want to use a cookie instead of a session to
decide when to swap connections. You can write your own class:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class MyCookieResolver
  # code for your cookie class
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>And then pass it to the middleware:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.active_record.database_selector = { delay: 2.seconds }
config.active_record.database_resolver = ActiveRecord::Middleware::DatabaseSelector::Resolver
config.active_record.database_resolver_context = MyCookieResolver

</pre>
</div>
</body>
