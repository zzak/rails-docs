<p>While Rails tries to do most of the work for you there are still some steps you'll
need to do to get your application ready for multiple databases.</p>

<p>Let's say we have an application with a single primary database and we need to add a
new database for some new tables we're adding. The name of the new database will be
"animals".</p>

<p>The <code>database.yml</code> looks like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
production:
  database: my_primary_database
  user: root
  adapter: mysql

</pre>
</div>
<p>Let's add a replica for the primary, a new writer called animals and a replica for that
as well. To do this we need to change our <code>database.yml</code> from a 2-tier to a 3-tier config.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
production:
  primary:
    database: my_primary_database
    user: root
    adapter: mysql
  primary_replica:
    database: my_primary_database
    user: root_readonly
    adapter: mysql
    replica: true
  animals:
    database: my_animals_database
    user: animals_root
    adapter: mysql
    migrations_paths: db/animals_migrate
  animals_replica:
    database: my_animals_database
    user: animals_readonly
    adapter: mysql
    replica: true

</pre>
</div>
<p>When using multiple databases there are a few important settings.</p>

<p>First, the database name for the primary and replica should be the same because they contain
the same data. Second, the username for the primary and replica should be different, and the
replica user's permissions should be to read and not write.</p>

<p>When using a replica database you need to add a <code>replica: true</code> entry to the replica in the
<code>database.yml</code>. This is because Rails otherwise has no way of knowing which one is a replica
and which one is the primary.</p>

<p>Lastly, for new primary databases you need to set the <code>migrations_paths</code> to the directory
where you will store migrations for that database. We'll look more at <code>migrations_paths</code>
later on in this guide.</p>

<p>Now that we have a new database, let's set up the model. In order to use the new database we
need to create a new abstract class and connect to the animals databases.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class AnimalsBase &lt; ApplicationRecord
  self.abstract_class = true

  connects_to database: { writing: :animals, reading: :animals_replica }
end

</pre>
</div>
<p> Then we need to
update <code>ApplicationRecord</code> to be aware of our new replica.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ApplicationRecord &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true

  connects_to database: { writing: :primary, reading: :primary_replica }
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>By default Rails expects the database roles to be <code>writing</code> and <code>reading</code> for the primary
and replica respectively. If you have a legacy system you may already have roles set up that
you don't want to change. In that case you can set a new role name in your application config.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.active_record.writing_role = :default
config.active_record.reading_role = :readonly

</pre>
</div>
<p>It's important to connect to your database in a single model and then inherit from that model
for the tables rather than connect multiple individual models to the same database. Database
clients have a limit to the number of open connections there can be and if you do this it will
multiply the number of connections you have since Rails uses the model class name for the
connection specification name.</p>

<p>Now that we have the <code>database.yml</code> and the new model set up it's time to create the databases.
Rails 6.0 ships with all the rails tasks you need to use multiple databases in Rails.</p>

<p>You can run <code>rails -T</code> to see all the commands you're able to run. You should see the following:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ rails -T
rails db:create                          # Creates the database from DATABASE_URL or config/database.yml for the ...
rails db:create:animals                  # Create animals database for current environment
rails db:create:primary                  # Create primary database for current environment
rails db:drop                            # Drops the database from DATABASE_URL or config/database.yml for the cu...
rails db:drop:animals                    # Drop animals database for current environment
rails db:drop:primary                    # Drop primary database for current environment
rails db:migrate                         # Migrate the database (options: VERSION=x, VERBOSE=false, SCOPE=blog)
rails db:migrate:animals                 # Migrate animals database for current environment
rails db:migrate:primary                 # Migrate primary database for current environment
rails db:migrate:status                  # Display status of migrations
rails db:migrate:status:animals          # Display status of migrations for animals database
rails db:migrate:status:primary          # Display status of migrations for primary database

</pre>
</div>
<p>Running a command like <code>rails db:create</code> will create both the primary and animals databases.
Note that there is no command for creating the users and you'll need to do that manually
to support the readonly users for your replicas. If you want to create just the animals
database you can run <code>rails db:create:animals</code>.</p>
