<p>There are some cases where you may want your application to connect to a primary or a replica
and the automatic connection switching isn't adequate. For example, you may know that for a
particular request you always want to send the request to a replica, even when you are in a
POST request path.</p>

<p>To do this Rails provides a <code>connected_to</code> method that will switch to the connection you
need.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :reading) do
  # all code in this block will be connected to the reading role
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The "role" in the <code>connected_to</code> call looks up the connections that are connected on that
connection handler (or role). The <code>reading</code> connection handler will hold all the connections
that were connected via <code>connects_to</code> with the role name of <code>reading</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>connected_to</code> with a role will look up an existing connection and switch
using the connection specification name. This means that if you pass an unknown role
like <code>connected_to(role: :nonexistent)</code> you will get an error that says
<code>ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished (No connection pool with 'AnimalsBase' found
for the 'nonexistent' role.)</code></p>
