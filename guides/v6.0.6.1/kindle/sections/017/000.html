<p>Action Text brings rich text content and editing to Rails. It includes
the <a href="https://trix-editor.org">Trix editor</a> that handles everything from formatting
to links to quotes to lists to embedded images and galleries.
The rich text content generated by the Trix editor is saved in its own
RichText model that's associated with any existing Active Record model in the application.
Any embedded images (or other attachments) are automatically stored using
Active Storage and associated with the included RichText model.</p>
