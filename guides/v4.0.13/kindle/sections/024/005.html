<h3 id="improving-engine-functionality">6 Improving engine functionality</h3>
<p>This section explains how to add and/or override engine MVC functionality in the main Rails application.</p>
<h4 id="overriding-models-and-controllers">6.1 Overriding Models and Controllers</h4>
<p>Engine model and controller classes can be extended by open classing them in the main Rails application (since model and controller classes are just Ruby classes that inherit Rails specific functionality). Open classing an Engine class redefines it for use in the main application. This is usually implemented by using the decorator pattern.</p>
<p>For simple class modifications use <code>Class#class_eval</code>, and for complex class modifications, consider using <code>ActiveSupport::Concern</code>.</p>

<h5 id="implementing-decorator-pattern-using-activesupport-concern">6.1.2 Implementing Decorator Pattern Using ActiveSupport::Concern</h5>
<p>Using <code>Class#class_eval</code> is great for simple adjustments, but for more complex class modifications, you might want to consider using <a href="http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html"><code>ActiveSupport::Concern</code></a>. ActiveSupport::Concern manages load order of interlinked dependent modules and classes at run time allowing you to significantly modularize your code.</p>

<h4 id="overriding-views">6.2 Overriding views</h4>
<p>When Rails looks for a view to render, it will first look in the <code>app/views</code> directory of the application. If it cannot find the view there, then it will check in the <code>app/views</code> directories of all engines which have this directory.</p>
<p>In the <code>blorgh</code> engine, there is a currently a file at <code>app/views/blorgh/posts/index.html.erb</code>. When the engine is asked to render the view for <code>Blorgh::PostsController</code>'s <code>index</code> action, it will first see if it can find it at <code>app/views/blorgh/posts/index.html.erb</code> within the application and then if it cannot it will look inside the engine.</p>
<p>You can override this view in the application by simply creating a new file at <code>app/views/blorgh/posts/index.html.erb</code>. Then you can completely change what this view would normally output.</p>
<p>Try this now by creating a new file at <code>app/views/blorgh/posts/index.html.erb</code> and put this content in it:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;h1&gt;Posts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;%= link_to "New Post", new_post_path %&gt;
&lt;% @posts.each do |post| %&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= post.title %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;By &lt;%= post.author %&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
  &lt;%= simple_format(post.text) %&gt;
  &lt;hr&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="routes">6.3 Routes</h4>
<p>Routes inside an engine are, by default, isolated from the application. This is done by the <code>isolate_namespace</code> call inside the <code>Engine</code> class. This essentially means that the application and its engines can have identically named routes and they will not clash.</p>
<p>Routes inside an engine are drawn on the <code>Engine</code> class within <code>config/routes.rb</code>, like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Blorgh::Engine.routes.draw do
  resources :posts
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>By having isolated routes such as this, if you wish to link to an area of an engine from within an application, you will need to use the engine's routing proxy method. Calls to normal routing methods such as <code>posts_path</code> may end up going to undesired locations if both the application and the engine both have such a helper defined.</p>
<p>For instance, the following example would go to the application's <code>posts_path</code> if that template was rendered from the application, or the engine's <code>posts_path</code> if it was rendered from the engine:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= link_to "Blog posts", posts_path %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>To make this route always use the engine's <code>posts_path</code> routing helper method, we must call the method on the routing proxy method that shares the same name as the engine.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= link_to "Blog posts", blorgh.posts_path %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you wish to reference the application inside the engine in a similar way, use the <code>main_app</code> helper:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= link_to "Home", main_app.root_path %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you were to use this inside an engine, it would <strong>always</strong> go to the application's root. If you were to leave off the <code>main_app</code> "routing proxy" method call, it could potentially go to the engine's or application's root, depending on where it was called from.</p>
<p>If a template is rendered from within an engine and it's attempting to use one of the application's routing helper methods, it may result in an undefined method call. If you encounter such an issue, ensure that you're not attempting to call the application's routing methods without the <code>main_app</code> prefix from within the engine.</p>
<h4 id="assets">6.4 Assets</h4>
<p>Assets within an engine work in an identical way to a full application. Because the engine class inherits from <code>Rails::Engine</code>, the application will know to look up in the engine's <code>app/assets</code> and <code>lib/assets</code> directories for potential assets.</p>
<p>Much like all the other components of an engine, the assets should also be namespaced. This means if you have an asset called <code>style.css</code>, it should be placed at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/[engine name]/style.css</code>, rather than <code>app/assets/stylesheets/style.css</code>. If this asset wasn't namespaced, then there is a possibility that the host application could have an asset named identically, in which case the application's asset would take precedence and the engine's one would be all but ignored.</p>
<p>Imagine that you did have an asset located at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/blorgh/style.css</code> To include this asset inside an application, just use <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> and reference the asset as if it were inside the engine:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag "blorgh/style.css" %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>You can also specify these assets as dependencies of other assets using the Asset Pipeline require statements in processed files:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
/*
 *= require blorgh/style
*/

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p>Remember that in order to use languages like Sass or CoffeeScript, you should add the relevant library to your engine's <code>.gemspec</code>.</p></div>
<h4 id="separate-assets-precompiling">6.5 Separate Assets &amp; Precompiling</h4>
<p>There are some situations where your engine's assets are not required by the host application. For example, say that you've created
an admin functionality that only exists for your engine. In this case, the host application doesn't need to require <code>admin.css</code>
or <code>admin.js</code>. Only the gem's admin layout needs these assets. It doesn't make sense for the host app to include <code>"blorg/admin.css"</code> in it's stylesheets. In this situation, you should explicitly define these assets for precompilation.
This tells sprockets to add your engine assets when <code>rake assets:precompile</code> is ran.</p>
<p>You can define assets for precompilation in <code>engine.rb</code></p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
initializer "blorgh.assets.precompile" do |app|
  app.config.assets.precompile += %w(admin.css admin.js)
end

</pre>
</div>

<h4 id="other-gem-dependencies">6.6 Other gem dependencies</h4>
<p>Gem dependencies inside an engine should be specified inside the
<code>.gemspec</code> file at the root of the engine. The reason is that the engine may
be installed as a gem. If dependencies were to be specified inside the <code>Gemfile</code>,
these would not be recognized by a traditional gem install and so they would not
be installed, causing the engine to malfunction.</p>
<p>To specify a dependency that should be installed with the engine during a
traditional <code>gem install</code>, specify it inside the <code>Gem::Specification</code> block
inside the <code>.gemspec</code> file in the engine:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
s.add_dependency "moo"

</pre>
</div>
<p>To specify a dependency that should only be installed as a development
dependency of the application, specify it like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
s.add_development_dependency "moo"

</pre>
</div>
<p>Both kinds of dependencies will be installed when <code>bundle install</code> is run inside
the application. The development dependencies for the gem will only be used when
the tests for the engine are running.</p>
<p>Note that if you want to immediately require dependencies when the engine is
required, you should require them before the engine's initialization. For example:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'other_engine/engine'
require 'yet_another_engine/engine'

module MyEngine
  class Engine &lt; ::Rails::Engine
  end
end
