<h3 id="setup-and-teardown">8 Setup and Teardown</h3>
<p>If you would like to run a block of code before the start of each test and another block of code after the end of each test you have two special callbacks for your rescue. Let's take note of this by looking at an example for our functional test in <code>Posts</code> controller:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'test_helper'

class PostsControllerTest &lt; ActionController::TestCase

  # called before every single test
  def setup
    @post = posts(:one)
  end

  # called after every single test
  def teardown
    # as we are re-initializing @post before every test
    # setting it to nil here is not essential but I hope
    # you understand how you can use the teardown method
    @post = nil
  end

  test "should show post" do
    get :show, id: @post.id
    assert_response :success
  end

  test "should destroy post" do
    assert_difference('Post.count', -1) do
      delete :destroy, id: @post.id
    end

    assert_redirected_to posts_path
  end

end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Above, the <code>setup</code> method is called before each test and so <code>@post</code> is available for each of the tests. Rails implements <code>setup</code> and <code>teardown</code> as <code>ActiveSupport::Callbacks</code>. Which essentially means you need not only use <code>setup</code> and <code>teardown</code> as methods in your tests. You could specify them by using:</p>
<ul>
<li>a block</li>
<li>a method (like in the earlier example)</li>
<li>a method name as a symbol</li>
<li>a lambda</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see the earlier example by specifying <code>setup</code> callback by specifying a method name as a symbol:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'test_helper'

class PostsControllerTest &lt; ActionController::TestCase

  # called before every single test
  setup :initialize_post

  # called after every single test
  def teardown
    @post = nil
  end

  test "should show post" do
    get :show, id: @post.id
    assert_response :success
  end

  test "should update post" do
    patch :update, id: @post.id, post: {}
    assert_redirected_to post_path(assigns(:post))
  end

  test "should destroy post" do
    assert_difference('Post.count', -1) do
      delete :destroy, id: @post.id
    end

    assert_redirected_to posts_path
  end

  private

  def initialize_post
    @post = posts(:one)
  end

end

</pre>
</div>
</body>
</html>
