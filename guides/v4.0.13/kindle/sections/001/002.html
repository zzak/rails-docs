<h3 id="creating-a-new-rails-project">3 Creating a New Rails Project</h3>
<p>The best way to use this guide is to follow each step as it happens, no code or
step needed to make this example application has been left out, so you can
literally follow along step by step.</p>
<p>By following along with this guide, you'll create a Rails project called
<code>blog</code>, a
(very) simple weblog. Before you can start building the application, you need to
make sure that you have Rails itself installed.</p>
<div class="info"><p>The examples below use <code>#</code> and <code>$</code> to denote superuser and regular
user terminal prompts respectively in a UNIX-like OS. If you are using
Windows, your prompt will look something like <code>c:\source_code&gt;</code></p></div>
<h4 id="installing-rails">3.1 Installing Rails</h4>
<p>Open up a command line prompt. On Mac OS X open Terminal.app, on Windows choose
"Run" from your Start menu and type 'cmd.exe'. Any commands prefaced with a
dollar sign <code>$</code> should be run in the command line. Verify that you have a
current version of Ruby installed:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ ruby -v
ruby 1.9.3p385

</pre>
</div>
<p>To install Rails, use the <code>gem install</code> command provided by RubyGems:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ gem install rails

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p>A number of tools exist to help you quickly install Ruby and Ruby
on Rails on your system. Windows users can use <a href="http://railsinstaller.org">Rails Installer</a>, while Mac OS X users can use
<a href="http://railsoneclick.com">Rails One Click</a>.</p></div>
<p>To verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ rails --version

</pre>
</div>
<p>If it says something like "Rails 4.0.0", you are ready to continue.</p>
<h4 id="creating-the-blog-application">3.2 Creating the Blog Application</h4>
<p>Rails comes with a number of scripts called generators that are designed to make your development life easier by creating everything that's necessary to start working on a particular task. One of these is the new application generator, which will provide you with the foundation of a fresh Rails application so that you don't have to write it yourself.</p>
<p>To use this generator, open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you have rights to create files, and type:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ rails new blog

</pre>
</div>
<p>This will create a Rails application called Blog in a directory called blog and install the gem dependencies that are already mentioned in <code>Gemfile</code> using <code>bundle install</code>.</p>
<div class="info"><p>You can see all of the command line options that the Rails
application builder accepts by running <code>rails new -h</code>.</p></div>
<p>After you create the blog application, switch to its folder to continue work directly in that application:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd blog

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>rails new blog</code> command we ran above created a folder in your
working directory called <code>blog</code>. The <code>blog</code> directory has a number of
auto-generated files and folders that make up the structure of a Rails
application. Most of the work in this tutorial will happen in the <code>app/</code> folder, but here's a basic rundown on the function of each of the files and folders that Rails created by default:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>File/Folder</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>app/</td>
<td>Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bin/</td>
<td>Contains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to deploy or run your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>config/</td>
<td>Configure your application's runtime rules, routes, database, and more.  This is covered in more detail in <a href="configuring.html">Configuring Rails Applications</a>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>config.ru</td>
<td>Rack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>db/</td>
<td>Contains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gemfile<br>Gemfile.lock</td>
<td>These files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see <a href="http://gembundler.com">the Bundler website</a>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>lib/</td>
<td>Extended modules for your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>log/</td>
<td>Application log files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>public/</td>
<td>The only folder seen to the world as-is. Contains the static files and compiled assets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rakefile</td>
<td>This file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>README.rdoc</td>
<td>This is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>test/</td>
<td>Unit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus. These are covered in <a href="testing.html">Testing Rails Applications</a>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tmp/</td>
<td>Temporary files (like cache, pid and session files)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>vendor/</td>
<td>A place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application, this includes Ruby Gems and the Rails source code (if you optionally install it into your project).</td>
</tr>
