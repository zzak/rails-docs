<h3 id="what-is-rails-questionmark">2 What is Rails?</h3>
<p>Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language.
It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions
about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less
code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks.
Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application
development more fun.</p>
<p>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is the "best"
way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to
discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a
tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from
other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you
learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</p>
<p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>DRY - "Don't Repeat Yourself" - suggests that writing the same code over and over again is a bad thing.</li>
<li>Convention Over Configuration - means that Rails makes assumptions about what you want to do and how you're going to
do it, rather than requiring you to specify every little thing through endless configuration files.</li>
</ul>
