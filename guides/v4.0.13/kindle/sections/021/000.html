<h3 id="basic-caching">1 Basic Caching</h3>
<p>This is an introduction to three types of caching techniques: page, action and
fragment caching. Rails provides by default fragment caching. In order to use
page and action caching, you will need to add <code>actionpack-page_caching</code> and
<code>actionpack-action_caching</code> to your Gemfile.</p>
<p>To start playing with caching you'll want to ensure that <code>config.action_controller.perform_caching</code> is set to <code>true</code>, if you're running in development mode. This flag is normally set in the corresponding <code>config/environments/*.rb</code> and caching is disabled by default for development and test, and enabled for production.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="page-caching">1.1 Page Caching</h4>
<p>Page caching is a Rails mechanism which allows the request for a generated page to be fulfilled by the webserver (i.e. Apache or nginx), without ever having to go through the Rails stack at all. Obviously, this is super-fast. Unfortunately, it can't be applied to every situation (such as pages that need authentication) and since the webserver is literally just serving a file from the filesystem, cache expiration is an issue that needs to be dealt with.</p>
<div class="info"><p>Page Caching has been removed from Rails 4. See the <a href="https://github.com/rails/actionpack-page_caching">actionpack-page_caching gem</a>. See <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3113-how-key-based-cache-expiration-works">DHH's key-based cache expiration overview</a> for the newly-preferred method.</p></div>
<h4 id="action-caching">1.2 Action Caching</h4>
<p>Page Caching cannot be used for actions that have before filters - for example, pages that require authentication. This is where Action Caching comes in. Action Caching works like Page Caching except the incoming web request hits the Rails stack so that before filters can be run on it before the cache is served. This allows authentication and other restrictions to be run while still serving the result of the output from a cached copy.</p>
<div class="info"><p>Action Caching has been removed from Rails 4. See the <a href="https://github.com/rails/actionpack-action_caching">actionpack-action_caching gem</a>. See <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3113-how-key-based-cache-expiration-works">DHH's key-based cache expiration overview</a> for the newly-preferred method.</p></div>
<h4 id="fragment-caching">1.3 Fragment Caching</h4>
<p>Life would be perfect if we could get away with caching the entire contents of a page or action and serving it out to the world. Unfortunately, dynamic web applications usually build pages with a variety of components not all of which have the same caching characteristics. In order to address such a dynamically created page where different parts of the page need to be cached and expired differently, Rails provides a mechanism called Fragment Caching.</p>
<p>Fragment Caching allows a fragment of view logic to be wrapped in a cache block and served out of the cache store when the next request comes in.</p>
<p>As an example, if you wanted to show all the orders placed on your website in real time and didn't want to cache that part of the page, but did want to cache the part of the page which lists all products available, you could use this piece of code:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% Order.find_recent.each do |o| %&gt;
  &lt;%= o.buyer.name %&gt; bought &lt;%= o.product.name %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;% cache do %&gt;
  All available products:
  &lt;% Product.all.each do |p| %&gt;
    &lt;%= link_to p.name, product_url(p) %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>The cache block in our example will bind to the action that called it and is written out to the same place as the Action Cache, which means that if you want to cache multiple fragments per action, you should provide an <code>action_suffix</code> to the cache call:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% cache(action: 'recent', action_suffix: 'all_products') do %&gt;
  All available products:

</pre>
</div>
<p>and you can expire it using the <code>expire_fragment</code> method, like so:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
expire_fragment(controller: 'products', action: 'recent', action_suffix: 'all_products')

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you don't want the cache block to bind to the action that called it, you can also use globally keyed fragments by calling the <code>cache</code> method with a key:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% cache('all_available_products') do %&gt;
  All available products:
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>This fragment is then available to all actions in the <code>ProductsController</code> using the key and can be expired the same way:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
expire_fragment('all_available_products')

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you want to avoid expiring the fragment manually, whenever an action updates a product, you can define a helper method:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module ProductsHelper
  def cache_key_for_products
    count          = Product.count
    max_updated_at = Product.maximum(:updated_at).try(:utc).try(:to_s, :number)
    "products/all-#{count}-#{max_updated_at}"
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This method generates a cache key that depends on all products and can be used in the view:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% cache(cache_key_for_products) do %&gt;
  All available products:
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>You can also use an Active Record model as the cache key:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% Product.all.each do |p| %&gt;
  &lt;% cache(p) do %&gt;
    &lt;%= link_to p.name, product_url(p) %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Behind the scenes, a method called <code>cache_key</code> will be invoked on the model and it returns a string like <code>products/23-20130109142513</code>. The cache key includes the model name, the id and finally the updated_at timestamp. Thus it will automatically generate a new fragment when the product is updated because the key changes.</p>
<p>You can also combine the two schemes which is called "Russian Doll Caching":</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% cache(cache_key_for_products) do %&gt;
  All available products:
  &lt;% Product.all.each do |p| %&gt;
    &lt;% cache(p) do %&gt;
      &lt;%= link_to p.name, product_url(p) %&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>It's called "Russian Doll Caching" because it nests multiple fragments. The advantage is that if a single product is updated, all the other inner fragments can be reused when regenerating the outer fragment.</p>
<h4 id="sql-caching">1.4 SQL Caching</h4>
<p>Query caching is a Rails feature that caches the result set returned by each query so that if Rails encounters the same query again for that request, it will use the cached result set as opposed to running the query against the database again.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ProductsController &lt; ApplicationController

  def index
    # Run a find query
    @products = Product.all

    ...

    # Run the same query again
    @products = Product.all
  end

end

</pre>
</div>
