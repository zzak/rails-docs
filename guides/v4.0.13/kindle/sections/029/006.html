<h3 id="contributing-to-the-rails-code">7 Contributing to the Rails Code</h3>
<h4 id="clone-the-rails-repository">7.1 Clone the Rails Repository</h4>
<p>The first thing you need to do to be able to contribute code is to clone the repository:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git clone git://github.com/rails/rails.git

</pre>
</div>
<p>and create a dedicated branch:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd rails
$ git checkout -b my_new_branch

</pre>
</div>
<p>It doesn’t matter much what name you use, because this branch will only exist on your local computer and your personal repository on GitHub. It won't be part of the Rails Git repository.</p>
<h4 id="write-your-code">7.2 Write Your Code</h4>
<p>Now get busy and add or edit code. You’re on your branch now, so you can write whatever you want (you can check to make sure you’re on the right branch with <code>git branch -a</code>). But if you’re planning to submit your change back for inclusion in Rails, keep a few things in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the code right.</li>
<li>Use Rails idioms and helpers.</li>
<li>Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it.</li>
<li>Update the (surrounding) documentation, examples elsewhere, and the guides: whatever is affected by your contribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not customary in Rails to run the full test suite before pushing
changes. The railties test suite in particular takes a long time, and even
more if the source code is mounted in <code>/vagrant</code> as happens in the recommended
workflow with the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box">rails-dev-box</a>.</p>
<p>As a compromise, test what your code obviously affects, and if the change is
not in railties run the whole test suite of the affected component. If all is
green that's enough to propose your contribution. We have <a href="https://travis-ci.org/rails/rails">Travis CI</a>
as a safety net for catching unexpected breakages
elsewhere.</p>
<div class="info"><p>Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted.</p></div>
<h4 id="follow-the-coding-conventions">7.3 Follow the Coding Conventions</h4>
<p>Rails follows a simple set of coding style conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two spaces, no tabs (for indentation).</li>
<li>No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any spaces.</li>
<li>Indent after private/protected.</li>
<li>Use Ruby &gt;= 1.9 syntax for hashes. Prefer <code>{ a: :b }</code> over <code>{ :a =&gt; :b }</code>.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>&amp;&amp;</code>/<code>||</code> over <code>and</code>/<code>or</code>.</li>
<li>Prefer class &lt;&lt; self over self.method for class methods.</li>
<li>Use <code>MyClass.my_method(my_arg)</code> not <code>my_method( my_arg )</code> or <code>my_method my_arg</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>a = b</code> and not <code>a=b</code>.</li>
<li>Use assert_not methods instead of refute.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>method { do_stuff }</code> instead of <code>method{do_stuff}</code> for single-line blocks.</li>
<li>Follow the conventions in the source you see used already.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are guidelines — please use your best judgment in using them.</p>
<h4 id="updating-the-changelog">7.4 Updating the CHANGELOG</h4>
<p>The CHANGELOG is an important part of every release. It keeps the list of changes for every Rails version.</p>
<p>You should add an entry to the CHANGELOG of the framework that you modified if you're adding or removing a feature, committing a bug fix or adding deprecation notices. Refactorings and documentation changes generally should not go to the CHANGELOG.</p>
<p>A CHANGELOG entry should summarize what was changed and should end with author's name. You can use multiple lines if you need more space and you can attach code examples indented with 4 spaces. If a change is related to a specific issue, you should attach issue's number. Here is an example CHANGELOG entry:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
*   Summary of a change that briefly describes what was changed. You can use multiple
    lines and wrap them at around 80 characters. Code examples are ok, too, if needed:

        class Foo
          def bar
            puts 'baz'
          end
        end

    You can continue after the code example and you can attach issue number. GH#1234

    *Your Name*

</pre>
</div>
<p>Your name can be added directly after the last word if you don't provide any code examples or don't need multiple paragraphs. Otherwise, it's best to make as a new paragraph.</p>
<h4 id="sanity-check">7.5 Sanity Check</h4>
<p>You should not be the only person who looks at the code before you submit it.
If you know someone else who uses Rails, try asking them if they'll check out
your work. If you don't know anyone else using Rails, try hopping into the IRC
room or posting about your idea to the rails-core mailing list.  Doing this in
private before you push a patch out publicly is the “smoke test” for a patch:
if you can’t convince one other developer of the beauty of your code, you’re
unlikely to convince the core team either.</p>
<h4 id="commit-your-changes">7.6 Commit Your Changes</h4>
<p>When you're happy with the code on your computer, you need to commit the changes to Git:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git commit -a

</pre>
</div>
<p>At this point, your editor should be fired up and you can write a message for this commit. Well formatted and descriptive commit messages are extremely helpful for the others, especially when figuring out why given change was made, so please take the time to write it.</p>
<p>Good commit message should be formatted according to the following example:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Short summary (ideally 50 characters or less)

More detailed description, if necessary. It should be wrapped to 72
characters. Try to be as descriptive as you can, even if you think that
the commit content is obvious, it may not be obvious to others. You
should add such description also if it's already present in bug tracker,
it should not be necessary to visit a webpage to check the history.

Description can have multiple paragraphs and you can use code examples
inside, just indent it with 4 spaces:

    class PostsController
      def index
        respond_with Post.limit(10)
      end
    end

You can also add bullet points:

- you can use dashes or asterisks

- also, try to indent next line of a point for readability, if it's too
  long to fit in 72 characters

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p>Please squash your commits into a single commit when appropriate. This simplifies future cherry picks, and also keeps the git log clean.</p></div>
<h4 id="update-your-branch">7.7 Update Your Branch</h4>
<p>It’s pretty likely that other changes to master have happened while you were working. Go get them:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout master
$ git pull --rebase

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now reapply your patch on top of the latest changes:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout my_new_branch
$ git rebase master

</pre>
</div>
<p>No conflicts? Tests still pass? Change still seems reasonable to you? Then move on.</p>
<h4 id="fork">7.8 Fork</h4>
<p>Navigate to the Rails <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">GitHub repository</a> and press "Fork" in the upper right hand corner.</p>
<p>Add the new remote to your local repository on your local machine:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git remote add mine git@github.com:&lt;your user name&gt;/rails.git

</pre>
</div>
<p>Push to your remote:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git push mine my_new_branch

</pre>
</div>
<p>You might have cloned your forked repository into your machine and might want to add the original Rails repository as a remote instead, if that's the case here's what you have to do.</p>
<p>In the directory you cloned your fork:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git remote add rails git://github.com/rails/rails.git

</pre>
</div>
<p>Download new commits and branches from the official repository:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git fetch rails

</pre>
</div>
<p>Merge the new content:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase rails/master

</pre>
</div>
<p>Update your fork:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git push origin master

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you want to update another branch:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout branch_name
$ git rebase rails/branch_name
$ git push origin branch_name

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="issue-a-pull-request">7.9 Issue a Pull Request</h4>
<p>Navigate to the Rails repository you just pushed to (e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/your-user-name/rails">https://github.com/your-user-name/rails</a>) and click on "Pull Requests" seen in
the right panel. On the next page, press "New pull request" in the upper right
hand corner.</p>
<p>Click on "Edit", if you need to change the branches being compared (it compares
"master" by default) and press "Click to create a pull request for this
comparison".</p>
<p>Ensure the changesets you introduced are included. Fill in some details about
your potential patch including a meaningful title. When finished, press "Send
pull request". The Rails core team will be notified about your submission.</p>
<h4 id="get-some-feedback">7.10 Get some Feedback</h4>
<p>Most pull requests will go through a few iterations before they get merged.
Different contributors will sometimes have different opinions, and often
patches will need revised before they can get merged.</p>
<p>Some contributors to Rails have email notifications from GitHub turned on, but
others do not. Furthermore, (almost) everyone who works on Rails is a
volunteer, and so it may take a few days for you to get your first feedback on
a pull request. Don't despair! Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's slow. Such
is the open source life.</p>
<p>If it's been over a week, and you haven't heard anything, you might want to try
and nudge things along. You can use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/">rubyonrails-core mailing
list</a> for this. You can also
leave another comment on the pull request.</p>
<p>While you're waiting for feedback on your pull request, open up a few other
pull requests and give someone else some! I'm sure they'll appreciate it in
the same way that you appreciate feedback on your patches.</p>
<h4 id="iterate-as-necessary">7.11 Iterate as Necessary</h4>
<p>It’s entirely possible that the feedback you get will suggest changes. Don’t get discouraged: the whole point of contributing to an active open source project is to tap into community knowledge. If people are encouraging you to tweak your code, then it’s worth making the tweaks and resubmitting. If the feedback is that your code doesn’t belong in the core, you might still think about releasing it as a gem.</p>
<h5 id="squashing-commits">7.11.1 Squashing commits</h5>
<p>One of the things that we may ask you to do is "squash your commits," which
will combine all of your commits into a single commit. We prefer pull requests
that are a single commit. This makes it easier to backport changes to stable
branches, squashing makes it easier to revert bad commits, and the git history
can be a bit easier to follow. Rails is a large project, and a bunch of
extraneous commits can add a lot of noise.</p>
<p>In order to do this, you'll need to have a git remote that points at the main
Rails repository. This is useful anyway, but just in case you don't have it set
up, make sure that you do this first:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/rails/rails.git

</pre>
</div>
<p>You can call this remote whatever you'd like, but if you don't use <code>upstream</code>,
then change the name to your own in the instructions below.</p>
<p>Given that your remote branch is called <code>my_pull_request</code>, then you can do the
following:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout my_pull_request
$ git rebase upstream/master
$ git rebase -i

&lt; Choose 'squash' for all of your commits except the first one. &gt;
&lt; Edit the commit message to make sense, and describe all your changes. &gt;

$ git push origin my_pull_request -f

</pre>
</div>
<p>You should be able to refresh the pull request on GitHub and see that it has
been updated.</p>
<h4 id="backporting">7.12 Backporting</h4>
<p>Changes that are merged into master are intended for the next major release of Rails. Sometimes, it might be beneficial for your changes to propagate back to the maintenance releases for older stable branches. Generally, security fixes and bug fixes are good candidates for a backport, while new features and patches that introduce a change in behavior will not be accepted. When in doubt, it is best to consult a Rails team member before backporting your changes to avoid wasted effort.</p>
<p>For simple fixes, the easiest way to backport your changes is to <a href="http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git">extract a diff from your changes in master and apply them to the target branch</a>.</p>
<p>First make sure your changes are the only difference between your current branch and master:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git log master..HEAD

</pre>
</div>
<p>Then extract the diff:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git format-patch master --stdout &gt; ~/my_changes.patch

</pre>
</div>
<p>Switch over to the target branch and apply your changes:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout -b my_backport_branch 3-2-stable
$ git apply ~/my_changes.patch

</pre>
</div>
<p>This works well for simple changes. However, if your changes are complicated or if the code in master has deviated significantly from your target branch, it might require more work on your part. The difficulty of a backport varies greatly from case to case, and sometimes it is simply not worth the effort.</p>
<p>Once you have resolved all conflicts and made sure all the tests are passing, push your changes and open a separate pull request for your backport. It is also worth noting that older branches might have a different set of build targets than master. When possible, it is best to first test your backport locally against the Ruby versions listed in <code>.travis.yml</code> before submitting your pull request.</p>
<p>And then... think about your next contribution!</p>
