<h3 id="validations">6 Validations</h3>
<p>Active Record allows you to validate the state of a model before it gets written
into the database. There are several methods that you can use to check your
models and validate that an attribute value is not empty, is unique and not
already in the database, follows a specific format and many more.</p>
<p>Validation is a very important issue to consider when persisting to database, so
the methods <code>create</code>, <code>save</code> and <code>update</code> take it into account when
running: they return <code>false</code> when validation fails and they didn't actually
perform any operation on database. All of these have a bang counterpart (that
is, <code>create!</code>, <code>save!</code> and <code>update!</code>), which are stricter in that
they raise the exception <code>ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid</code> if validation fails.
A quick example to illustrate:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, presence: true
end

User.create  # =&gt; false
User.create! # =&gt; ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name can't be blank

</pre>
</div>
