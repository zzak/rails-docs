<h3 id="database-pooling">7 Database pooling</h3>
<p>Active Record database connections are managed by <code>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool</code> which ensures that a connection pool synchronizes the amount of thread access to a limited number of database connections. This limit defaults to 5 and can be configured in <code>database.yml</code>.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

</pre>
</div>
<p>Since the connection pooling is handled inside of Active Record by default, all application servers (Thin, mongrel, Unicorn etc.) should behave the same. Initially, the database connection pool is empty and it will create additional connections as the demand for them increases, until it reaches the connection pool limit.</p>
<p>Any one request will check out a connection the first time it requires access to the database, after which it will check the connection back in, at the end of the request, meaning that the additional connection slot will be available again for the next request in the queue.</p>
<div class="note"><p>If you have enabled <code>Rails.threadsafe!</code> mode then there could be a chance that several threads may be accessing multiple connections simultaneously. So depending on your current request load, you could very well have multiple threads contending for a limited amount of connections.</p></div>
