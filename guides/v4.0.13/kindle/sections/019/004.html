<h3 id="using-initializer-files">5 Using Initializer Files</h3>
<p>After loading the framework and any gems in your application, Rails turns to loading initializers. An initializer is any Ruby file stored under <code>config/initializers</code> in your application. You can use initializers to hold configuration settings that should be made after all of the frameworks and gems are loaded, such as options to configure settings for these parts.</p>
<div class="note"><p>You can use subfolders to organize your initializers if you like, because Rails will look into the whole file hierarchy from the initializers folder on down.</p></div>
<div class="info"><p>If you have any ordering dependency in your initializers, you can control the load order through naming. Initializer files are loaded in alphabetical order by their path. For example, <code>01_critical.rb</code> will be loaded before <code>02_normal.rb</code>.</p></div>
