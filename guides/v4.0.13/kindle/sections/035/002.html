<h3 id="major-features">3 Major Features</h3>
<h4 id="faster-development-mode-routing">3.1 Faster Development Mode &amp; Routing</h4>
<p>Rails 3.2 comes with a development mode that's noticeably faster. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/paneq/active_reload">Active Reload</a>, Rails reloads classes only when files actually change. The performance gains are dramatic on a larger application. Route recognition also got a bunch faster thanks to the new <a href="https://github.com/rails/journey">Journey</a> engine.</p>
<h4 id="automatic-query-explains">3.2 Automatic Query Explains</h4>
<p>Rails 3.2 comes with a nice feature that explains queries generated by Arel by defining an <code>explain</code> method in <code>ActiveRecord::Relation</code>. For example, you can run something like <code>puts Person.active.limit(5).explain</code> and the query Arel produces is explained. This allows to check for the proper indexes and further optimizations.</p>
<p>Queries that take more than half a second to run are <em>automatically</em> explained in the development mode. This threshold, of course, can be changed.</p>
<h4 id="tagged-logging">3.3 Tagged Logging</h4>
<p>When running a multi-user, multi-account application, it's a great help to be able to filter the log by who did what. TaggedLogging in Active Support helps in doing exactly that by stamping log lines with subdomains, request ids, and anything else to aid debugging such applications.</p>
