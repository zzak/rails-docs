<p>Assets can also come from external sources in the form of gems.</p>
<p>A good example of this is the <code>jquery-rails</code> gem which comes with Rails as the standard JavaScript library gem. This gem contains an engine class which inherits from <code>Rails::Engine</code>. By doing this, Rails is informed that the directory for this gem may contain assets and the <code>app/assets</code>, <code>lib/assets</code> and <code>vendor/assets</code> directories of this engine are added to the search path of Sprockets.</p>
