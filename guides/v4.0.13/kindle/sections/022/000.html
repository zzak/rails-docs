<h3 id="what-is-the-asset-pipeline-questionmark">1 What is the Asset Pipeline?</h3>
<p>The asset pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets. It also adds the ability to write these assets in other languages such as CoffeeScript, Sass and ERB.</p>
<p>Making the asset pipeline a core feature of Rails means that all developers can benefit from the power of having their assets pre-processed, compressed and minified by one central library, Sprockets. This is part of Rails' "fast by default" strategy as outlined by DHH in his keynote at RailsConf 2011.</p>
<p>The asset pipeline is enabled by default. It can be disabled in <code>config/application.rb</code> by putting this line inside the application class definition:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.assets.enabled = false

</pre>
</div>
<p>You can also disable the asset pipeline while creating a new application by passing the <code>--skip-sprockets</code> option.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
rails new appname --skip-sprockets

</pre>
</div>
<p>You should use the defaults for all new applications unless you have a specific reason to avoid the asset pipeline.</p>
<h4 id="main-features">1.1 Main Features</h4>
<p>The first feature of the pipeline is to concatenate assets. This is important in a production environment, because it can reduce the number of requests that a browser makes to render a web page. Web browsers are limited in the number of requests that they can make in parallel, so fewer requests can mean faster loading for your application.</p>
<p>Rails 2.x introduced the ability to concatenate JavaScript and CSS assets by placing <code>cache: true</code> at the end of the <code>javascript_include_tag</code> and <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> methods. But this technique has some limitations. For example, it cannot generate the caches in advance, and it is not able to transparently include assets provided by third-party libraries.</p>
<p>Starting with version 3.1, Rails defaults to concatenating all JavaScript files into one master <code>.js</code> file and all CSS files into one master <code>.css</code> file. As you'll learn later in this guide, you can customize this strategy to group files any way you like. In production, Rails inserts an MD5 fingerprint into each filename so that the file is cached by the web browser. You can invalidate the cache by altering this fingerprint, which happens automatically whenever you change the file contents.</p>
<p>The second feature of the asset pipeline is asset minification or compression. For CSS files, this is done by removing whitespace and comments. For JavaScript, more complex processes can be applied. You can choose from a set of built in options or specify your own.</p>
<p>The third feature of the asset pipeline is that it allows coding assets via a higher-level language, with precompilation down to the actual assets. Supported languages include Sass for CSS, CoffeeScript for JavaScript, and ERB for both by default.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark">1.2 What is Fingerprinting and Why Should I Care?</h4>
<p>Fingerprinting is a technique that makes the name of a file dependent on the contents of the file. When the file contents change, the filename is also changed. For content that is static or infrequently changed, this provides an easy way to tell whether two versions of a file are identical, even across different servers or deployment dates.</p>
<p>When a filename is unique and based on its content, HTTP headers can be set to encourage caches everywhere (whether at CDNs, at ISPs, in networking equipment, or in web browsers) to keep their own copy of the content. When the content is updated, the fingerprint will change. This will cause the remote clients to request a new copy of the content. This is generally known as <em>cache busting</em>.</p>
<p>The technique that Rails uses for fingerprinting is to insert a hash of the content into the name, usually at the end. For example a CSS file <code>global.css</code> could be renamed with an MD5 digest of its contents:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
global-908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.css

</pre>
</div>
<p>This is the strategy adopted by the Rails asset pipeline.</p>
<p>Rails' old strategy was to append a date-based query string to every asset linked with a built-in helper. In the source the generated code looked like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
/stylesheets/global.css?1309495796

</pre>
</div>
<p>The query string strategy has several disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Not all caches will reliably cache content where the filename only differs by query parameters</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/">Steve Souders recommends</a>, "...avoiding a querystring for cacheable resources". He found that in this case 5-20% of requests will not be cached. Query strings in particular do not work at all with some CDNs for cache invalidation.</li>
<li>
<strong>The file name can change between nodes in multi-server environments.</strong><br>
The default query string in Rails 2.x is based on the modification time of the files. When assets are deployed to a cluster, there is no guarantee that the timestamps will be the same, resulting in different values being used depending on which server handles the request.</li>
<li>
<strong>Too much cache invalidation</strong><br>
When static assets are deployed with each new release of code, the mtime(time of last modification) of <em>all</em> these files changes, forcing all remote clients to fetch them again, even when the content of those assets has not changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fingerprinting fixes these problems by avoiding query strings, and by ensuring that filenames are consistent based on their content.</p>
<p>Fingerprinting is enabled by default for production and disabled for all other environments. You can enable or disable it in your configuration through the <code>config.assets.digest</code> option.</p>
