<p>In Rails, an <em>association</em> is a connection between two Active Record models. Why do we need associations between models? Because they make common operations simpler and easier in your code. For example, consider a simple Rails application that includes a model for authors and a model for books. Each author can have many books. Without associations, the model declarations would look like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Author &lt; ApplicationRecord
end

class Book &lt; ApplicationRecord
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now, suppose we wanted to add a new book for an existing author. We'd need to do something like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@book = Book.create(published_at: Time.now, author_id: @author.id)

</pre>
</div>
<p>Or consider deleting an author, and ensuring that all of its books get deleted as well:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@books = Book.where(author_id: @author.id)
@books.each do |book|
  book.destroy
end
@author.destroy

</pre>
</div>
<p>With Active Record associations, we can streamline these - and other - operations by declaratively telling Rails that there is a connection between the two models. Here's the revised code for setting up authors and books:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Author &lt; ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books, dependent: :destroy
end

class Book &lt; ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :author
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>With this change, creating a new book for a particular author is easier:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@book = @author.books.create(published_at: Time.now)

</pre>
</div>
<p>Deleting an author and all of its books is <em>much</em> easier:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@author.destroy

</pre>
</div>
