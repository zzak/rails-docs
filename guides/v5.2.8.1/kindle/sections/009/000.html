<p>In Rails, web requests are handled by <a href="action_controller_overview.html">Action Controller</a> and Action View. Typically, Action Controller is concerned with communicating with the database and performing CRUD actions where necessary. Action View is then responsible for compiling the response.</p>

<p>Action View templates are written using embedded Ruby in tags mingled with HTML. To avoid cluttering the templates with boilerplate code, a number of helper classes provide common behavior for forms, dates, and strings. It's also easy to add new helpers to your application as it evolves.</p>

<div class="note"><p>Some features of Action View are tied to Active Record, but that doesn't mean Action View depends on Active Record. Action View is an independent package that can be used with any sort of Ruby libraries.</p></div>
