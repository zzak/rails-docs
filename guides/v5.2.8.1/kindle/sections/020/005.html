<h3 id="user-management"><a class="anchorlink" href="#user-management">6 User Management</a></h3>
<div class="note"><p><em>Almost every web application has to deal with authorization and authentication. Instead of rolling your own, it is advisable to use common plug-ins. But keep them up-to-date, too. A few additional precautions can make your application even more secure.</em></p></div>

<p>There are a number of authentication plug-ins for Rails available. Good ones, such as the popular <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">devise</a> and <a href="https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">authlogic</a>, store only encrypted passwords, not plain-text passwords. In Rails 3.1 you can use the built-in <code>has_secure_password</code> method which has similar features.</p>

<p>Every new user gets an activation code to activate their account when they get an e-mail with a link in it. After activating the account, the activation_code columns will be set to NULL in the database. If someone requested a URL like these, they would be logged in as the first activated user found in the database (and chances are that this is the administrator):</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
http://localhost:3006/user/activate
http://localhost:3006/user/activate?id=

</pre>
</div>
<p>This is possible because on some servers, this way the parameter id, as in params[:id], would be nil. However, here is the finder from the activation action:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
User.find_by_activation_code(params[:id])

</pre>
</div>
<p>If the parameter was nil, the resulting SQL query will be</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
SELECT * FROM users WHERE (users.activation_code IS NULL) LIMIT 1

</pre>
</div>
<p>And thus it found the first user in the database, returned it and logged them in. You can find out more about it in <a href="http://www.rorsecurity.info/2007/10/28/restful_authentication-login-security/">this blog post</a>. <em>It is advisable to update your plug-ins from time to time</em>. Moreover, you can review your application to find more flaws like this.</p>

<h4 id="brute-forcing-accounts"><a class="anchorlink" href="#brute-forcing-accounts">6.1 Brute-Forcing Accounts</a></h4>

<div class="note"><p><em>Brute-force attacks on accounts are trial and error attacks on the login credentials. Fend them off with more generic error messages and possibly require to enter a CAPTCHA.</em></p></div>

<p>A list of user names for your web application may be misused to brute-force the corresponding passwords, because most people don't use sophisticated passwords. Most passwords are a combination of dictionary words and possibly numbers. So armed with a list of user names and a dictionary, an automatic program may find the correct password in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Because of this, most web applications will display a generic error message "user name or password not correct", if one of these are not correct. If it said "the user name you entered has not been found", an attacker could automatically compile a list of user names.</p>

<p>However, what most web application designers neglect, are the forgot-password pages. These pages often admit that the entered user name or e-mail address has (not) been found. This allows an attacker to compile a list of user names and brute-force the accounts.</p>

<p>In order to mitigate such attacks, <em>display a generic error message on forgot-password pages, too</em>. Moreover, you can <em>require to enter a CAPTCHA after a number of failed logins from a certain IP address</em>. Note, however, that this is not a bullet-proof solution against automatic programs, because these programs may change their IP address exactly as often. However, it raises the barrier of an attack.</p>

<h4 id="account-hijacking"><a class="anchorlink" href="#account-hijacking">6.2 Account Hijacking</a></h4>

<p>Many web applications make it easy to hijack user accounts. Why not be different and make it more difficult?.</p>

<h5 id="passwords"><a class="anchorlink" href="#passwords">6.2.1 Passwords</a></h5>

<p>Think of a situation where an attacker has stolen a user's session cookie and thus may co-use the application. If it is easy to change the password, the attacker will hijack the account with a few clicks. Or if the change-password form is vulnerable to CSRF, the attacker will be able to change the victim's password by luring them to a web page where there is a crafted IMG-tag which does the CSRF. As a countermeasure, <em>make change-password forms safe against CSRF</em>, of course. And <em>require the user to enter the old password when changing it</em>.</p>

<h5 id="e-mail"><a class="anchorlink" href="#e-mail">6.2.2 E-Mail</a></h5>

<p>However, the attacker may also take over the account by changing the e-mail address. After they change it, they will go to the forgotten-password page and the (possibly new) password will be mailed to the attacker's e-mail address. As a countermeasure <em>require the user to enter the password when changing the e-mail address, too</em>.</p>

<h5 id="other"><a class="anchorlink" href="#other">6.2.3 Other</a></h5>

<p>Depending on your web application, there may be more ways to hijack the user's account. In many cases CSRF and XSS will help to do so. For example, as in a CSRF vulnerability in <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/google-gmail-e-mail-hijack-technique/">Google Mail</a>. In this proof-of-concept attack, the victim would have been lured to a web site controlled by the attacker. On that site is a crafted IMG-tag which results in an HTTP GET request that changes the filter settings of Google Mail. If the victim was logged in to Google Mail, the attacker would change the filters to forward all e-mails to their e-mail address. This is nearly as harmful as hijacking the entire account. As a countermeasure, <em>review your application logic and eliminate all XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities</em>.</p>

<h4 id="captchas"><a class="anchorlink" href="#captchas">6.3 CAPTCHAs</a></h4>

<div class="info"><p><em>A CAPTCHA is a challenge-response test to determine that the response is not generated by a computer. It is often used to protect registration forms from attackers and comment forms from automatic spam bots by asking the user to type the letters of a distorted image. This is the positive CAPTCHA, but there is also the negative CAPTCHA. The idea of a negative CAPTCHA is not for a user to prove that they are human, but reveal that a robot is a robot.</em></p></div>

<p>A popular positive CAPTCHA API is <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">reCAPTCHA</a> which displays two distorted images of words from old books. It also adds an angled line, rather than a distorted background and high levels of warping on the text as earlier CAPTCHAs did, because the latter were broken. As a bonus, using reCAPTCHA helps to digitize old books. <a href="https://github.com/ambethia/recaptcha/">ReCAPTCHA</a> is also a Rails plug-in with the same name as the API.</p>

<p>You will get two keys from the API, a public and a private key, which you have to put into your Rails environment. After that you can use the recaptcha_tags method in the view, and the verify_recaptcha method in the controller. Verify_recaptcha will return false if the validation fails.
The problem with CAPTCHAs is that they have a negative impact on the user experience. Additionally, some visually impaired users have found certain kinds of distorted CAPTCHAs difficult to read. Still, positive CAPTCHAs are one of the best methods to prevent all kinds of bots from submitting forms.</p>

<p>Most bots are really dumb. They crawl the web and put their spam into every form's field they can find. Negative CAPTCHAs take advantage of that and include a "honeypot" field in the form which will be hidden from the human user by CSS or JavaScript.</p>

<p>Note that negative CAPTCHAs are only effective against dumb bots and won't suffice to protect critical applications from targeted bots. Still, the negative and positive CAPTCHAs can be combined to increase the performance, e.g.,  if the "honeypot" field is not empty (bot detected), you won't need to verify the positive CAPTCHA, which would require an HTTPS request to Google ReCaptcha before computing the response.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas how to hide honeypot fields by JavaScript and/or CSS:</p>
<ul>
<li>position the fields off of the visible area of the page</li>
<li>make the elements very small or color them the same as the background of the page</li>
<li>leave the fields displayed, but tell humans to leave them blank</li>
</ul>
<p>The most simple negative CAPTCHA is one hidden honeypot field. On the server side, you will check the value of the field: If it contains any text, it must be a bot. Then, you can either ignore the post or return a positive result, but not saving the post to the database. This way the bot will be satisfied and moves on.</p>

<p>You can find more sophisticated negative CAPTCHAs in Ned Batchelder's <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/stopbots.html">blog post</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a field with the current UTC time-stamp in it and check it on the server. If it is too far in the past, or if it is in the future, the form is invalid.</li>
<li>Randomize the field names</li>
<li>Include more than one honeypot field of all types, including submission buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this protects you only from automatic bots, targeted tailor-made bots cannot be stopped by this. So <em>negative CAPTCHAs might not be good to protect login forms</em>.</p>

<h4 id="logging"><a class="anchorlink" href="#logging">6.4 Logging</a></h4>

<div class="warning"><p><em>Tell Rails not to put passwords in the log files.</em></p></div>

<p>By default, Rails logs all requests being made to the web application. But log files can be a huge security issue, as they may contain login credentials, credit card numbers et cetera. When designing a web application security concept, you should also think about what will happen if an attacker got (full) access to the web server. Encrypting secrets and passwords in the database will be quite useless, if the log files list them in clear text. You can <em>filter certain request parameters from your log files</em> by appending them to <code>config.filter_parameters</code> in the application configuration. These parameters will be marked [FILTERED] in the log.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.filter_parameters &lt;&lt; :password

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>Provided parameters will be filtered out by partial matching regular expression. Rails adds default <code>:password</code> in the appropriate initializer (<code>initializers/filter_parameter_logging.rb</code>) and cares about typical application parameters <code>password</code> and <code>password_confirmation</code>.</p></div>

<h4 id="good-passwords"><a class="anchorlink" href="#good-passwords">6.5 Good Passwords</a></h4>

<div class="info"><p><em>Do you find it hard to remember all your passwords? Don't write them down, but use the initial letters of each word in an easy to remember sentence.</em></p></div>

<p>Bruce Schneier, a security technologist, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/12/realworld_passw.html">has analyzed</a> 34,000 real-world user names and passwords from the MySpace phishing attack mentioned <a href="#examples-from-the-underground">below</a>. It turns out that most of the passwords are quite easy to crack. The 20 most common passwords are:</p>

<p>password1, abc123, myspace1, password, blink182, qwerty1, ****you, 123abc, baseball1, football1, 123456, soccer, monkey1, liverpool1, princess1, jordan23, slipknot1, superman1, iloveyou1, and monkey.</p>

<p>It is interesting that only 4% of these passwords were dictionary words and the great majority is actually alphanumeric. However, password cracker dictionaries contain a large number of today's passwords, and they try out all kinds of (alphanumerical) combinations. If an attacker knows your user name and you use a weak password, your account will be easily cracked.</p>

<p>A good password is a long alphanumeric combination of mixed cases. As this is quite hard to remember, it is advisable to enter only the <em>first letters of a sentence that you can easily remember</em>. For example "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" will be "Tqbfjotld". Note that this is just an example, you should not use well known phrases like these, as they might appear in cracker dictionaries, too.</p>

<h4 id="regular-expressions"><a class="anchorlink" href="#regular-expressions">6.6 Regular Expressions</a></h4>

<div class="info"><p><em>A common pitfall in Ruby's regular expressions is to match the string's beginning and end by ^ and $, instead of \A and \z.</em></p></div>

<p>Ruby uses a slightly different approach than many other languages to match the end and the beginning of a string. That is why even many Ruby and Rails books get this wrong. So how is this a security threat? Say you wanted to loosely validate a URL field and you used a simple regular expression like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
  /^https?:\/\/[^\n]+$/i

</pre>
</div>
<p>This may work fine in some languages. However, <em>in Ruby ^ and $ match the <strong>line</strong> beginning and line end</em>. And thus a URL like this passes the filter without problems:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
javascript:exploit_code();/*
http://hi.com
*/

</pre>
</div>
<p>This URL passes the filter because the regular expression matches - the second line, the rest does not matter. Now imagine we had a view that showed the URL like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
  link_to "Homepage", @user.homepage

</pre>
</div>
<p>The link looks innocent to visitors, but when it's clicked, it will execute the JavaScript function "exploit_code" or any other JavaScript the attacker provides.</p>

<p>To fix the regular expression, \A and \z should be used instead of ^ and $, like so:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
  /\Ahttps?:\/\/[^\n]+\z/i

</pre>
</div>
<p>Since this is a frequent mistake, the format validator (validates_format_of) now raises an exception if the provided regular expression starts with ^ or ends with $. If you do need to use ^ and $ instead of \A and \z (which is rare), you can set the :multiline option to true, like so:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
  # content should include a line "Meanwhile" anywhere in the string
  validates :content, format: { with: /^Meanwhile$/, multiline: true }

</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that this only protects you against the most common mistake when using the format validator - you always need to keep in mind that ^ and $ match the <strong>line</strong> beginning and line end in Ruby, and not the beginning and end of a string.</p>

<h4 id="privilege-escalation"><a class="anchorlink" href="#privilege-escalation">6.7 Privilege Escalation</a></h4>

<div class="warning"><p><em>Changing a single parameter may give the user unauthorized access. Remember that every parameter may be changed, no matter how much you hide or obfuscate it.</em></p></div>

<p>The most common parameter that a user might tamper with, is the id parameter, as in <code>http://www.domain.com/project/1</code>, whereas 1 is the id. It will be available in params in the controller. There, you will most likely do something like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@project = Project.find(params[:id])

</pre>
</div>
<p>This is alright for some web applications, but certainly not if the user is not authorized to view all projects. If the user changes the id to 42, and they are not allowed to see that information, they will have access to it anyway. Instead, <em>query the user's access rights, too</em>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@project = @current_user.projects.find(params[:id])

</pre>
</div>
<p>Depending on your web application, there will be many more parameters the user can tamper with. As a rule of thumb, <em>no user input data is secure, until proven otherwise, and every parameter from the user is potentially manipulated</em>.</p>

<p>Don't be fooled by security by obfuscation and JavaScript security. Developer tools let you review and change every form's hidden fields. <em>JavaScript can be used to validate user input data, but certainly not to prevent attackers from sending malicious requests with unexpected values</em>. The Firebug addon for Mozilla Firefox logs every request and may repeat and change them. That is an easy way to bypass any JavaScript validations. And there are even client-side proxies that allow you to intercept any request and response from and to the Internet.</p>
