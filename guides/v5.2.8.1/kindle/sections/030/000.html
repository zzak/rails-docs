<p>Traditionally, when people said that they used Rails as an "API", they meant
providing a programmatically accessible API alongside their web application.
For example, GitHub provides <a href="https://developer.github.com">an API</a> that you
can use from your own custom clients.</p>

<p>With the advent of client-side frameworks, more developers are using Rails to
build a back-end that is shared between their web application and other native
applications.</p>

<p>For example, Twitter uses its <a href="https://dev.twitter.com">public API</a> in its web
application, which is built as a static site that consumes JSON resources.</p>

<p>Instead of using Rails to generate HTML that communicates with the server
through forms and links, many developers are treating their web application as
just an API client delivered as HTML with JavaScript that consumes a JSON API.</p>

<p>This guide covers building a Rails application that serves JSON resources to an
API client, including client-side frameworks.</p>
