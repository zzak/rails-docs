<p>System tests clean up test data by rolling back a transaction. Because destroy
is never called on an object, the attached files are never cleaned up. If you
want to clear the files, you can do it in an <code>after_teardown</code> callback. Doing it
here ensures that all connections created during the test are complete and
you won't receive an error from Active Storage saying it can't find a file.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ApplicationSystemTestCase &lt; ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  driven_by :selenium, using: :chrome, screen_size: [1400, 1400]

  def remove_uploaded_files
    FileUtils.rm_rf("#{Rails.root}/storage_test")
  end

  def after_teardown
    super
    remove_uploaded_files
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>If your system tests verify the deletion of a model with attachments and you're
using Active Job, set your test environment to use the inline queue adapter so
the purge job is executed immediately rather at an unknown time in the future.</p>

<p>You may also want to use a separate service definition for the test environment
so your tests don't delete the files you create during development.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# Use inline job processing to make things happen immediately
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :inline

# Separate file storage in the test environment
config.active_storage.service = :local_test

</pre>
</div>
</body>
