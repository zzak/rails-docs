<p>Active Support is the Ruby on Rails component responsible for providing Ruby language extensions, utilities, and other transversal utilities.</p>

<p>Rails code can often be referenced on load of an application. Rails is responsible for the load order of these frameworks, so when you load frameworks, such as <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>, prematurely you are violating an implicit contract your application has with Rails. Moreover, by loading code such as <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> on boot of your application you are loading entire frameworks which may slow down your boot time and could cause conflicts with load order and boot of your application.</p>

<p>On Load hooks are the API that allow you to hook into this initialization process without violating the load contract with Rails. This will also mitigate boot performance degradation and avoid conflicts.</p>
