<p>After loading the framework and any gems in your application, Rails turns to loading initializers. An initializer is any Ruby file stored under <code>config/initializers</code> in your application. You can use initializers to hold configuration settings that should be made after all of the frameworks and gems are loaded, such as options to configure settings for these parts.</p>

<div class="note"><p>You can use subfolders to organize your initializers if you like, because Rails will look into the whole file hierarchy from the initializers folder on down.</p></div>

<div class="info"><p>While Rails supports numbering of initializer file names for load ordering purposes, a better technique is to place any code that need to load in a specific order within the same file. This reduces file name churn, makes dependencies more explicit, and can help surface new concepts within your application.</p></div>
