<p>Since your custom jobs can be queued at different levels inside your application,
you'll need to test both the jobs themselves (their behavior when they get enqueued)
and that other entities correctly enqueue them.</p>

<h4 id="a-basic-test-case"><a class="anchorlink" href="#a-basic-test-case">12.1 A Basic Test Case</a></h4>

<p>By default, when you generate a job, an associated test will be generated as well
under the <code>test/jobs</code> directory. Here's an example test with a billing job:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'test_helper'

class BillingJobTest &lt; ActiveJob::TestCase
  test 'that account is charged' do
    BillingJob.perform_now(account, product)
    assert account.reload.charged_for?(product)
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This test is pretty simple and only asserts that the job got the work done
as expected.</p>

<p>By default, <code>ActiveJob::TestCase</code> will set the queue adapter to <code>:test</code> so that
your jobs are performed inline. It will also ensure that all previously performed
and enqueued jobs are cleared before any test run so you can safely assume that
no jobs have already been executed in the scope of each test.</p>

<h4 id="custom-assertions-and-testing-jobs-inside-other-components"><a class="anchorlink" href="#custom-assertions-and-testing-jobs-inside-other-components">12.2 Custom Assertions And Testing Jobs Inside Other Components</a></h4>

<p>Active Job ships with a bunch of custom assertions that can be used to lessen the verbosity of tests. For a full list of available assertions, see the API documentation for <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.8.1/classes/ActiveJob/TestHelper.html"><code>ActiveJob::TestHelper</code></a>.</p>

<p>It's a good practice to ensure that your jobs correctly get enqueued or performed
wherever you invoke them (e.g. inside your controllers). This is precisely where
the custom assertions provided by Active Job are pretty useful. For instance,
within a model:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'test_helper'

class ProductTest &lt; ActiveJob::TestCase
  test 'billing job scheduling' do
    assert_enqueued_with(job: BillingJob) do
      product.charge(account)
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
