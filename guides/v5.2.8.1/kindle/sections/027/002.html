<p>Given a string with a constant path we define its <em>parent namespace</em> to be the
string that results from removing its rightmost segment.</p>

<p>For example, the parent namespace of the string "A::B::C" is the string "A::B",
the parent namespace of "A::B" is "A", and the parent namespace of "A" is "".</p>

<p>The interpretation of a parent namespace when thinking about classes and modules
is tricky though. Let's consider a module M named "A::B":</p>
<ul>
<li>The parent namespace, "A", may not reflect nesting at a given spot.</li>
<li>The constant <code>A</code> may no longer exist, some code could have removed it from
<code>Object</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>A</code> exists, the class or module that was originally in <code>A</code> may not be there
anymore. For example, if after a constant removal there was another constant
assignment there would generally be a different object in there.</li>
<li>In such case, it could even happen that the reassigned <code>A</code> held a new class or
module called also "A"!</li>
<li>In the previous scenarios M would no longer be reachable through <code>A::B</code> but
the module object itself could still be alive somewhere and its name would
still be "A::B".</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of a parent namespace is at the core of the autoloading algorithms
and helps explain and understand their motivation intuitively, but as you see
that metaphor leaks easily. Given an edge case to reason about, take always into
account that by "parent namespace" the guide means exactly that specific string
derivation.</p>

<h4 id="loading-mechanism"><a class="anchorlink" href="#loading-mechanism">3.2 Loading Mechanism</a></h4>

<p>Rails autoloads files with <code>Kernel#load</code> when <code>config.cache_classes</code> is false,
the default in development mode, and with <code>Kernel#require</code> otherwise, the
default in production mode.</p>

<p><code>Kernel#load</code> allows Rails to execute files more than once if <a href="#constant-reloading">constant
reloading</a> is enabled.</p>

<p>This guide uses the word "load" freely to mean a given file is interpreted, but
the actual mechanism can be <code>Kernel#load</code> or <code>Kernel#require</code> depending on that
flag.</p>
