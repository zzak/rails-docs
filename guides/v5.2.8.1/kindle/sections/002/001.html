<p>When writing applications using other programming languages or frameworks, it
may be necessary to write a lot of configuration code. This is particularly true
for ORM frameworks in general. However, if you follow the conventions adopted by
Rails, you'll need to write very little configuration (in some cases no
configuration at all) when creating Active Record models. The idea is that if
you configure your applications in the very same way most of the time then this
should be the default way. Thus, explicit configuration would be needed
only in those cases where you can't follow the standard convention.</p>

<h4 id="naming-conventions"><a class="anchorlink" href="#naming-conventions">2.1 Naming Conventions</a></h4>

<p>By default, Active Record uses some naming conventions to find out how the
mapping between models and database tables should be created. Rails will
pluralize your class names to find the respective database table. So, for
a class <code>Book</code>, you should have a database table called <strong>books</strong>. The Rails
pluralization mechanisms are very powerful, being capable of pluralizing (and
singularizing) both regular and irregular words. When using class names composed
of two or more words, the model class name should follow the Ruby conventions,
using the CamelCase form, while the table name must contain the words separated
by underscores. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database Table - Plural with underscores separating words (e.g., <code>book_clubs</code>).</li>
<li>Model Class - Singular with the first letter of each word capitalized (e.g.,
<code>BookClub</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="schema-conventions"><a class="anchorlink" href="#schema-conventions">2.2 Schema Conventions</a></h4>

<p>Active Record uses naming conventions for the columns in database tables,
depending on the purpose of these columns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Foreign keys</strong> - These fields should be named following the pattern
<code>singularized_table_name_id</code> (e.g., <code>item_id</code>, <code>order_id</code>). These are the
fields that Active Record will look for when you create associations between
your models.</li>
<li>
<strong>Primary keys</strong> - By default, Active Record will use an integer column named
<code>id</code> as the table's primary key. When using <a href="active_record_migrations.html">Active Record
Migrations</a> to create your tables, this column will be
automatically created.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some optional column names that will add additional features
to Active Record instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>created_at</code> - Automatically gets set to the current date and time when the
record is first created.</li>
<li>
<code>updated_at</code> - Automatically gets set to the current date and time whenever
the record is updated.</li>
<li>
<code>lock_version</code> - Adds <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.8.1/classes/ActiveRecord/Locking.html">optimistic
locking</a> to
a model.</li>
<li>
<code>type</code> - Specifies that the model uses <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.8.1/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#class-ActiveRecord::Base-label-Single+table+inheritance">Single Table
Inheritance</a>.</li>
<li>
<code>(association_name)_type</code> - Stores the type for
<a href="association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations">polymorphic associations</a>.</li>
<li>
<code>(table_name)_count</code> - Used to cache the number of belonging objects on
associations. For example, a <code>comments_count</code> column in an <code>Article</code> class that
has many instances of <code>Comment</code> will cache the number of existent comments
for each article.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note"><p>While these column names are optional, they are in fact reserved by Active Record. Steer clear of reserved keywords unless you want the extra functionality. For example, <code>type</code> is a reserved keyword used to designate a table using Single Table Inheritance (STI). If you are not using STI, try an analogous keyword like "context", that may still accurately describe the data you are modeling.</p></div>
