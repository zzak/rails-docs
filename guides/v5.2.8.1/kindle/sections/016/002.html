<p>Receiving and parsing emails with Action Mailer can be a rather complex
endeavor. Before your email reaches your Rails app, you would have had to
configure your system to somehow forward emails to your app, which needs to be
listening for that. So, to receive emails in your Rails app you'll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a <code>receive</code> method in your mailer.</li>
<li>Configure your email server to forward emails from the address(es) you would
like your app to receive to <code>/path/to/app/bin/rails runner
'UserMailer.receive(STDIN.read)'</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a method called <code>receive</code> is defined in any mailer, Action Mailer will
parse the raw incoming email into an email object, decode it, instantiate a new
mailer, and pass the email object to the mailer <code>receive</code> instance
method. Here's an example:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class UserMailer &lt; ApplicationMailer
  def receive(email)
    page = Page.find_by(address: email.to.first)
    page.emails.create(
      subject: email.subject,
      body: email.body
    )

    if email.has_attachments?
      email.attachments.each do |attachment|
        page.attachments.create({
          file: attachment,
          description: email.subject
        })
      end
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
</body>
</html>
