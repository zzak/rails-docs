<h4 id="setting-up-a-development-environment"><a class="anchorlink" href="#setting-up-a-development-environment">5.1 Setting Up a Development Environment</a></h4>

<p>To move on from submitting bugs to helping resolve existing issues or contributing your own code to Ruby on Rails, you <em>must</em> be able to run its test suite. In this section of the guide, you'll learn how to setup the tests on your own computer.</p>

<h5 id="the-easy-way"><a class="anchorlink" href="#the-easy-way">5.1.1 The Easy Way</a></h5>

<p>The easiest and recommended way to get a development environment ready to hack is to use the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box">rails-dev-box</a>.</p>

<h5 id="the-hard-way"><a class="anchorlink" href="#the-hard-way">5.1.2 The Hard Way</a></h5>

<p>In case you can't use the Rails development box, see <a href="development_dependencies_install.html">this other guide</a>.</p>

<h4 id="clone-the-rails-repository"><a class="anchorlink" href="#clone-the-rails-repository">5.2 Clone the Rails Repository</a></h4>

<p>To be able to contribute code, you need to clone the Rails repository:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git clone https://github.com/rails/rails.git

</pre>
</div>
<p>and create a dedicated branch:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd rails
$ git checkout -b my_new_branch

</pre>
</div>
<p>It doesn't matter much what name you use, because this branch will only exist on your local computer and your personal repository on GitHub. It won't be part of the Rails Git repository.</p>

<h4 id="bundle-install"><a class="anchorlink" href="#bundle-install">5.3 Bundle install</a></h4>

<p>Install the required gems.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bundle install

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="running-an-application-against-your-local-branch"><a class="anchorlink" href="#running-an-application-against-your-local-branch">5.4 Running an Application Against Your Local Branch</a></h4>

<p>In case you need a dummy Rails app to test changes, the <code>--dev</code> flag of <code>rails new</code> generates an application that uses your local branch:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd rails
$ bundle exec rails new ~/my-test-app --dev

</pre>
</div>
<p>The application generated in <code>~/my-test-app</code> runs against your local branch
and in particular sees any modifications upon server reboot.</p>

<h4 id="write-your-code"><a class="anchorlink" href="#write-your-code">5.5 Write Your Code</a></h4>

<p>Now get busy and add/edit code. You're on your branch now, so you can write whatever you want (make sure you're on the right branch with <code>git branch -a</code>). But if you're planning to submit your change back for inclusion in Rails, keep a few things in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the code right.</li>
<li>Use Rails idioms and helpers.</li>
<li>Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it.</li>
<li>Update the (surrounding) documentation, examples elsewhere, and the guides: whatever is affected by your contribution.</li>
</ul>
<div class="info"><p>Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700">our rationales behind this decision</a>).</p></div>

<h5 id="follow-the-coding-conventions"><a class="anchorlink" href="#follow-the-coding-conventions">5.5.1 Follow the Coding Conventions</a></h5>

<p>Rails follows a simple set of coding style conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two spaces, no tabs (for indentation).</li>
<li>No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any spaces.</li>
<li>Indent after private/protected.</li>
<li>Use Ruby &gt;= 1.9 syntax for hashes. Prefer <code>{ a: :b }</code> over <code>{ :a =&gt; :b }</code>.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>&amp;&amp;</code>/<code>||</code> over <code>and</code>/<code>or</code>.</li>
<li>Prefer class &lt;&lt; self over self.method for class methods.</li>
<li>Use <code>my_method(my_arg)</code> not <code>my_method( my_arg )</code> or <code>my_method my_arg</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>a = b</code> and not <code>a=b</code>.</li>
<li>Use assert_not methods instead of refute.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>method { do_stuff }</code> instead of <code>method{do_stuff}</code> for single-line blocks.</li>
<li>Follow the conventions in the source you see used already.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are guidelines - please use your best judgment in using them.</p>

<h4 id="benchmark-your-code"><a class="anchorlink" href="#benchmark-your-code">5.6 Benchmark Your Code</a></h4>

<p>For changes that might have an impact on performance, please benchmark your
code and measure the impact. Please share the benchmark script you used as well
as the results. You should consider including this information in your commit
message, which allows future contributors to easily verify your findings and
determine if they are still relevant. (For example, future optimizations in the
Ruby VM might render certain optimizations unnecessary.)</p>

<p>It is very easy to make an optimization that improves performance for a
specific scenario you care about but regresses on other common cases.
Therefore, you should test your change against a list of representative
scenarios. Ideally, they should be based on real-world scenarios extracted
from production applications.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/benchmark.rb">benchmark template</a>
as a starting point. It includes the boilerplate code to setup a benchmark
using the <a href="https://github.com/evanphx/benchmark-ips">benchmark-ips</a> gem. The
template is designed for testing relatively self-contained changes that can be
inlined into the script.</p>

<h4 id="running-tests"><a class="anchorlink" href="#running-tests">5.7 Running Tests</a></h4>

<p>It is not customary in Rails to run the full test suite before pushing
changes. The railties test suite in particular takes a long time, and takes an
especially long time if the source code is mounted in <code>/vagrant</code> as happens in
the recommended workflow with the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box">rails-dev-box</a>.</p>

<p>As a compromise, test what your code obviously affects, and if the change is
not in railties, run the whole test suite of the affected component. If all
tests are passing, that's enough to propose your contribution. We have
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/rails/rails">Travis CI</a> as a safety net for catching
unexpected breakages elsewhere.</p>

<h5 id="entire-rails"><a class="anchorlink" href="#entire-rails">5.7.1 Entire Rails:</a></h5>

<p>To run all the tests, do:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd rails
$ bundle exec rake test

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="for-a-particular-component"><a class="anchorlink" href="#for-a-particular-component">5.7.2 For a Particular Component</a></h5>

<p>You can run tests only for a particular component (e.g. Action Pack). For example,
to run Action Mailer tests:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd actionmailer
$ bundle exec rake test

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="running-a-single-test"><a class="anchorlink" href="#running-a-single-test">5.7.3 Running a Single Test</a></h5>

<p>You can run a single test through ruby. For instance:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd actionmailer
$ bundle exec ruby -w -Itest test/mail_layout_test.rb -n test_explicit_class_layout

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>-n</code> option allows you to run a single method instead of the whole
file.</p>

<h5 id="testing-active-record"><a class="anchorlink" href="#testing-active-record">5.7.4 Testing Active Record</a></h5>

<p>First, create the databases you'll need. You can find a list of the required
table names, usernames, and passwords in <code>activerecord/test/config.example.yml</code>.</p>

<p>For MySQL and PostgreSQL, running the SQL statements <code>create database
activerecord_unittest</code> and <code>create database activerecord_unittest2</code> is
sufficient. This is not necessary for SQLite3.</p>

<p>This is how you run the Active Record test suite only for SQLite3:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ cd activerecord
$ bundle exec rake test:sqlite3

</pre>
</div>
<p>You can now run the tests as you did for <code>sqlite3</code>. The tasks are respectively:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
test:mysql2
test:postgresql

</pre>
</div>
<p>Finally,</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bundle exec rake test

</pre>
</div>
<p>will now run the three of them in turn.</p>

<p>You can also run any single test separately:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ ARCONN=sqlite3 bundle exec ruby -Itest test/cases/associations/has_many_associations_test.rb

</pre>
</div>
<p>To run a single test against all adapters, use:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bundle exec rake TEST=test/cases/associations/has_many_associations_test.rb

</pre>
</div>
<p>You can invoke <code>test_jdbcmysql</code>, <code>test_jdbcsqlite3</code> or <code>test_jdbcpostgresql</code> also. See the file <code>activerecord/RUNNING_UNIT_TESTS.rdoc</code> for information on running more targeted database tests, or the file <code>ci/travis.rb</code> for the test suite run by the continuous integration server.</p>

<h4 id="warnings"><a class="anchorlink" href="#warnings">5.8 Warnings</a></h4>

<p>The test suite runs with warnings enabled. Ideally, Ruby on Rails should issue no warnings, but there may be a few, as well as some from third-party libraries. Please ignore (or fix!) them, if any, and submit patches that do not issue new warnings.</p>

<p>If you are sure about what you are doing and would like to have a more clear output, there's a way to override the flag:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ RUBYOPT=-W0 bundle exec rake test

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="updating-the-changelog"><a class="anchorlink" href="#updating-the-changelog">5.9 Updating the CHANGELOG</a></h4>

<p>The CHANGELOG is an important part of every release. It keeps the list of changes for every Rails version.</p>

<p>You should add an entry <strong>to the top</strong> of the CHANGELOG of the framework that you modified if you're adding or removing a feature, committing a bug fix or adding deprecation notices. Refactorings and documentation changes generally should not go to the CHANGELOG.</p>

<p>A CHANGELOG entry should summarize what was changed and should end with the author's name. You can use multiple lines if you need more space and you can attach code examples indented with 4 spaces. If a change is related to a specific issue, you should attach the issue's number. Here is an example CHANGELOG entry:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
*   Summary of a change that briefly describes what was changed. You can use multiple
    lines and wrap them at around 80 characters. Code examples are ok, too, if needed:

        class Foo
          def bar
            puts 'baz'
          end
        end

    You can continue after the code example and you can attach issue number. GH#1234

    *Your Name*

</pre>
</div>
<p>Your name can be added directly after the last word if there are no code
examples or multiple paragraphs. Otherwise, it's best to make a new paragraph.</p>

<h4 id="updating-the-gemfile-lock"><a class="anchorlink" href="#updating-the-gemfile-lock">5.10 Updating the Gemfile.lock</a></h4>

<p>Some changes require the dependencies to be upgraded. In these cases make sure you run <code>bundle update</code> to get the right version of the dependency and commit the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file within your changes.</p>

<h4 id="commit-your-changes"><a class="anchorlink" href="#commit-your-changes">5.11 Commit Your Changes</a></h4>

<p>When you're happy with the code on your computer, you need to commit the changes to Git:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git commit -a

</pre>
</div>
<p>This should fire up your editor to write a commit message. When you have
finished, save and close to continue.</p>

<p>A well-formatted and descriptive commit message is very helpful to others for
understanding why the change was made, so please take the time to write it.</p>

<p>A good commit message looks like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Short summary (ideally 50 characters or less)

More detailed description, if necessary. It should be wrapped to
72 characters. Try to be as descriptive as you can. Even if you
think that the commit content is obvious, it may not be obvious
to others. Add any description that is already present in the
relevant issues; it should not be necessary to visit a webpage
to check the history.

The description section can have multiple paragraphs.

Code examples can be embedded by indenting them with 4 spaces:

    class ArticlesController
      def index
        render json: Article.limit(10)
      end
    end

You can also add bullet points:

- make a bullet point by starting a line with either a dash (-)
  or an asterisk (*)

- wrap lines at 72 characters, and indent any additional lines
  with 2 spaces for readability

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p>Please squash your commits into a single commit when appropriate. This
simplifies future cherry picks and keeps the git log clean.</p></div>

<h4 id="update-your-branch"><a class="anchorlink" href="#update-your-branch">5.12 Update Your Branch</a></h4>

<p>It's pretty likely that other changes to master have happened while you were working. Go get them:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout master
$ git pull --rebase

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now reapply your patch on top of the latest changes:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout my_new_branch
$ git rebase master

</pre>
</div>
<p>No conflicts? Tests still pass? Change still seems reasonable to you? Then move on.</p>

<h4 id="fork"><a class="anchorlink" href="#fork">5.13 Fork</a></h4>

<p>Navigate to the Rails <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">GitHub repository</a> and press "Fork" in the upper right hand corner.</p>

<p>Add the new remote to your local repository on your local machine:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git remote add fork https://github.com/&lt;your user name&gt;/rails.git

</pre>
</div>
<p>You may have cloned your local repository from rails/rails or you may have cloned from your forked repository. To avoid ambigity the following git commands assume that you have made a "rails" remote that points to rails/rails.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git remote add rails https://github.com/rails/rails.git

</pre>
</div>
<p>Download new commits and branches from the official repository:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git fetch rails

</pre>
</div>
<p>Merge the new content:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase rails/master
$ git checkout my_new_branch
$ git rebase rails/master

</pre>
</div>
<p>Update your fork:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git push fork master
$ git push fork my_new_branch

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="issue-a-pull-request"><a class="anchorlink" href="#issue-a-pull-request">5.14 Issue a Pull Request</a></h4>

<p>Navigate to the Rails repository you just pushed to (e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/your-user-name/rails">https://github.com/your-user-name/rails</a>) and click on "Pull Requests" seen in
the right panel. On the next page, press "New pull request" in the upper right
hand corner.</p>

<p>Click on "Edit", if you need to change the branches being compared (it compares
"master" by default) and press "Click to create a pull request for this
comparison".</p>

<p>Ensure the changesets you introduced are included. Fill in some details about
your potential patch including a meaningful title. When finished, press "Send
pull request". The Rails core team will be notified about your submission.</p>

<h4 id="get-some-feedback"><a class="anchorlink" href="#get-some-feedback">5.15 Get some Feedback</a></h4>

<p>Most pull requests will go through a few iterations before they get merged.
Different contributors will sometimes have different opinions, and often
patches will need to be revised before they can get merged.</p>

<p>Some contributors to Rails have email notifications from GitHub turned on, but
others do not. Furthermore, (almost) everyone who works on Rails is a
volunteer, and so it may take a few days for you to get your first feedback on
a pull request. Don't despair! Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's slow. Such
is the open source life.</p>

<p>If it's been over a week, and you haven't heard anything, you might want to try
and nudge things along. You can use the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubyonrails-core">rubyonrails-core mailing
list</a> for this. You can also
leave another comment on the pull request.</p>

<p>While you're waiting for feedback on your pull request, open up a few other
pull requests and give someone else some! I'm sure they'll appreciate it in
the same way that you appreciate feedback on your patches.</p>

<h4 id="iterate-as-necessary"><a class="anchorlink" href="#iterate-as-necessary">5.16 Iterate as Necessary</a></h4>

<p>It's entirely possible that the feedback you get will suggest changes. Don't get discouraged: the whole point of contributing to an active open source project is to tap into the knowledge of the community. If people are encouraging you to tweak your code, then it's worth making the tweaks and resubmitting. If the feedback is that your code doesn't belong in the core, you might still think about releasing it as a gem.</p>

<h5 id="squashing-commits"><a class="anchorlink" href="#squashing-commits">5.16.1 Squashing commits</a></h5>

<p>One of the things that we may ask you to do is to "squash your commits", which
will combine all of your commits into a single commit. We prefer pull requests
that are a single commit. This makes it easier to backport changes to stable
branches, squashing makes it easier to revert bad commits, and the git history
can be a bit easier to follow. Rails is a large project, and a bunch of
extraneous commits can add a lot of noise.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git fetch rails
$ git checkout my_new_branch
$ git rebase -i rails/master

&lt; Choose 'squash' for all of your commits except the first one. &gt;
&lt; Edit the commit message to make sense, and describe all your changes. &gt;

$ git push fork my_new_branch -f

</pre>
</div>
<p>You should be able to refresh the pull request on GitHub and see that it has
been updated.</p>

<h5 id="updating-pull-request"><a class="anchorlink" href="#updating-pull-request">5.16.2 Updating pull request</a></h5>

<p>Sometimes you will be asked to make some changes to the code you have
already committed. This can include amending existing commits. In this
case Git will not allow you to push the changes as the pushed branch
and local branch do not match. Instead of opening a new pull request,
you can force push to your branch on GitHub as described earlier in
squashing commits section:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git push fork my_new_branch -f

</pre>
</div>
<p>This will update the branch and pull request on GitHub with your new code. Do
note that using force push may result in commits being lost on the remote branch; use it with care.</p>

<h4 id="older-versions-of-ruby-on-rails"><a class="anchorlink" href="#older-versions-of-ruby-on-rails">5.17 Older Versions of Ruby on Rails</a></h4>

<p>If you want to add a fix to older versions of Ruby on Rails, you'll need to set up and switch to your own local tracking branch. Here is an example to switch to the 4-0-stable branch:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git branch --track 4-0-stable rails/4-0-stable
$ git checkout 4-0-stable

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p>You may want to <a href="http://qugstart.com/blog/git-and-svn/add-colored-git-branch-name-to-your-shell-prompt/">put your Git branch name in your shell prompt</a> to make it easier to remember which version of the code you're working with.</p></div>

<h5 id="backporting"><a class="anchorlink" href="#backporting">5.17.1 Backporting</a></h5>

<p>Changes that are merged into master are intended for the next major release of Rails. Sometimes, it might be beneficial for your changes to propagate back to the maintenance releases for older stable branches. Generally, security fixes and bug fixes are good candidates for a backport, while new features and patches that introduce a change in behavior will not be accepted. When in doubt, it is best to consult a Rails team member before backporting your changes to avoid wasted effort.</p>

<p>For simple fixes, the easiest way to backport your changes is to <a href="http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git">extract a diff from your changes in master and apply them to the target branch</a>.</p>

<p>First, make sure your changes are the only difference between your current branch and master:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git log master..HEAD

</pre>
</div>
<p>Then extract the diff:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git format-patch master --stdout &gt; ~/my_changes.patch

</pre>
</div>
<p>Switch over to the target branch and apply your changes:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ git checkout -b my_backport_branch 4-2-stable
$ git apply ~/my_changes.patch

</pre>
</div>
<p>This works well for simple changes. However, if your changes are complicated or if the code in master has deviated significantly from your target branch, it might require more work on your part. The difficulty of a backport varies greatly from case to case, and sometimes it is simply not worth the effort.</p>

<p>Once you have resolved all conflicts and made sure all the tests are passing, push your changes and open a separate pull request for your backport. It is also worth noting that older branches might have a different set of build targets than master. When possible, it is best to first test your backport locally against the Ruby versions listed in <code>.travis.yml</code> before submitting your pull request.</p>

<p>And then... think about your next contribution!</p>
