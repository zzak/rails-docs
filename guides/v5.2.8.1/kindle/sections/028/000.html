<h3 id="basic-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#basic-caching">1 Basic Caching</a></h3>
<p>This is an introduction to three types of caching techniques: page, action and
fragment caching. By default Rails provides fragment caching. In order to use
page and action caching you will need to add <code>actionpack-page_caching</code> and
<code>actionpack-action_caching</code> to your <code>Gemfile</code>.</p>

<p>By default, caching is only enabled in your production environment. To play
around with caching locally you'll want to enable caching in your local
environment by setting <code>config.action_controller.perform_caching</code> to <code>true</code> in
the relevant <code>config/environments/*.rb</code> file:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>Changing the value of <code>config.action_controller.perform_caching</code> will
only have an effect on the caching provided by the Action Controller component.
For instance, it will not impact low-level caching, that we address
<a href="#low-level-caching">below</a>.</p></div>

<h4 id="page-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#page-caching">1.1 Page Caching</a></h4>

<p>Page caching is a Rails mechanism which allows the request for a generated page
to be fulfilled by the webserver (i.e. Apache or NGINX) without having to go
through the entire Rails stack. While this is super fast it can't be applied to
every situation (such as pages that need authentication). Also, because the
webserver is serving a file directly from the filesystem you will need to
implement cache expiration.</p>

<div class="info"><p>Page Caching has been removed from Rails 4. See the <a href="https://github.com/rails/actionpack-page_caching">actionpack-page_caching gem</a>.</p></div>

<h4 id="action-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#action-caching">1.2 Action Caching</a></h4>

<p>Page Caching cannot be used for actions that have before filters - for example, pages that require authentication. This is where Action Caching comes in. Action Caching works like Page Caching except the incoming web request hits the Rails stack so that before filters can be run on it before the cache is served. This allows authentication and other restrictions to be run while still serving the result of the output from a cached copy.</p>

<div class="info"><p>Action Caching has been removed from Rails 4. See the <a href="https://github.com/rails/actionpack-action_caching">actionpack-action_caching gem</a>. See <a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3113-how-key-based-cache-expiration-works">DHH's key-based cache expiration overview</a> for the newly-preferred method.</p></div>

<h4 id="fragment-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#fragment-caching">1.3 Fragment Caching</a></h4>

<p>Dynamic web applications usually build pages with a variety of components not
all of which have the same caching characteristics. When different parts of the
page need to be cached and expired separately you can use Fragment Caching.</p>

<p>Fragment Caching allows a fragment of view logic to be wrapped in a cache block and served out of the cache store when the next request comes in.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to cache each product on a page, you could use this
code:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% @products.each do |product| %&gt;
  &lt;% cache product do %&gt;
    &lt;%= render product %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>When your application receives its first request to this page, Rails will write
a new cache entry with a unique key. A key looks something like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
views/products/1-201505056193031061005000/bea67108094918eeba42cd4a6e786901

</pre>
</div>
<p>The number in the middle is the <code>product_id</code> followed by the timestamp value in
the <code>updated_at</code> attribute of the product record. Rails uses the timestamp value
to make sure it is not serving stale data. If the value of <code>updated_at</code> has
changed, a new key will be generated. Then Rails will write a new cache to that
key, and the old cache written to the old key will never be used again. This is
called key-based expiration.</p>

<p>Cache fragments will also be expired when the view fragment changes (e.g., the
HTML in the view changes). The string of characters at the end of the key is a
template tree digest. It is a hash digest computed based on the contents of the
view fragment you are caching. If you change the view fragment, the digest will
change, expiring the existing file.</p>

<div class="info"><p>Cache stores like Memcached will automatically delete old cache files.</p></div>

<p>If you want to cache a fragment under certain conditions, you can use
<code>cache_if</code> or <code>cache_unless</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% cache_if admin?, product do %&gt;
  &lt;%= render product %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="collection-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#collection-caching">1.3.1 Collection caching</a></h5>

<p>The <code>render</code> helper can also cache individual templates rendered for a collection.
It can even one up the previous example with <code>each</code> by reading all cache
templates at once instead of one by one. This is done by passing <code>cached: true</code> when rendering the collection:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= render partial: 'products/product', collection: @products, cached: true %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>All cached templates from previous renders will be fetched at once with much
greater speed. Additionally, the templates that haven't yet been cached will be
written to cache and multi fetched on the next render.</p>

<h4 id="russian-doll-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#russian-doll-caching">1.4 Russian Doll Caching</a></h4>

<p>You may want to nest cached fragments inside other cached fragments. This is
called Russian doll caching.</p>

<p>The advantage of Russian doll caching is that if a single product is updated,
all the other inner fragments can be reused when regenerating the outer
fragment.</p>

<p>As explained in the previous section, a cached file will expire if the value of
<code>updated_at</code> changes for a record on which the cached file directly depends.
However, this will not expire any cache the fragment is nested within.</p>

<p>For example, take the following view:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% cache product do %&gt;
  &lt;%= render product.games %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Which in turn renders this view:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;% cache game do %&gt;
  &lt;%= render game %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>If any attribute of game is changed, the <code>updated_at</code> value will be set to the
current time, thereby expiring the cache. However, because <code>updated_at</code>
will not be changed for the product object, that cache will not be expired and
your app will serve stale data. To fix this, we tie the models together with
the <code>touch</code> method:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Product &lt; ApplicationRecord
  has_many :games
end

class Game &lt; ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :product, touch: true
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>With <code>touch</code> set to <code>true</code>, any action which changes <code>updated_at</code> for a game
record will also change it for the associated product, thereby expiring the
cache.</p>

<h4 id="shared-partial-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#shared-partial-caching">1.5 Shared Partial Caching</a></h4>

<p>It is possible to share partials and associated caching between files with different mime types. For example shared partial caching allows template writers to share a partial between HTML and JavaScript files. When templates are collected in the template resolver file paths they only include the template language extension and not the mime type. Because of this templates can be used for multiple mime types. Both HTML and JavaScript requests will respond to the following code:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
render(partial: 'hotels/hotel', collection: @hotels, cached: true)

</pre>
</div>
<p>Will load a file named <code>hotels/hotel.erb</code>.</p>

<p>Another option is to include the full filename of the partial to render.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
render(partial: 'hotels/hotel.html.erb', collection: @hotels, cached: true)

</pre>
</div>
<p>Will load a file named <code>hotels/hotel.html.erb</code> in any file mime type, for example you could include this partial in a JavaScript file.</p>

<h4 id="managing-dependencies"><a class="anchorlink" href="#managing-dependencies">1.6 Managing dependencies</a></h4>

<p>In order to correctly invalidate the cache, you need to properly define the
caching dependencies. Rails is clever enough to handle common cases so you don't
have to specify anything. However, sometimes, when you're dealing with custom
helpers for instance, you need to explicitly define them.</p>

<h5 id="implicit-dependencies"><a class="anchorlink" href="#implicit-dependencies">1.6.1 Implicit dependencies</a></h5>

<p>Most template dependencies can be derived from calls to <code>render</code> in the template
itself. Here are some examples of render calls that <code>ActionView::Digestor</code> knows
how to decode:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
render partial: "comments/comment", collection: commentable.comments
render "comments/comments"
render 'comments/comments'
render('comments/comments')

render "header" translates to render("comments/header")

render(@topic)         translates to render("topics/topic")
render(topics)         translates to render("topics/topic")
render(message.topics) translates to render("topics/topic")

</pre>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, some calls need to be changed to make caching work properly.
For instance, if you're passing a custom collection, you'll need to change:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
render @project.documents.where(published: true)

</pre>
</div>
<p>to:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
render partial: "documents/document", collection: @project.documents.where(published: true)

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="explicit-dependencies"><a class="anchorlink" href="#explicit-dependencies">1.6.2 Explicit dependencies</a></h5>

<p>Sometimes you'll have template dependencies that can't be derived at all. This
is typically the case when rendering happens in helpers. Here's an example:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= render_sortable_todolists @project.todolists %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>You'll need to use a special comment format to call those out:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%# Template Dependency: todolists/todolist %&gt;
&lt;%= render_sortable_todolists @project.todolists %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>In some cases, like a single table inheritance setup, you might have a bunch of
explicit dependencies. Instead of writing every template out, you can use a
wildcard to match any template in a directory:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%# Template Dependency: events/* %&gt;
&lt;%= render_categorizable_events @person.events %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>As for collection caching, if the partial template doesn't start with a clean
cache call, you can still benefit from collection caching by adding a special
comment format anywhere in the template, like:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%# Template Collection: notification %&gt;
&lt;% my_helper_that_calls_cache(some_arg, notification) do %&gt;
  &lt;%= notification.name %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="external-dependencies"><a class="anchorlink" href="#external-dependencies">1.6.3 External dependencies</a></h5>

<p>If you use a helper method, for example, inside a cached block and you then update
that helper, you'll have to bump the cache as well. It doesn't really matter how
you do it, but the MD5 of the template file must change. One recommendation is to
simply be explicit in a comment, like:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%# Helper Dependency Updated: Jul 28, 2015 at 7pm %&gt;
&lt;%= some_helper_method(person) %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="low-level-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#low-level-caching">1.7 Low-Level Caching</a></h4>

<p>Sometimes you need to cache a particular value or query result instead of caching view fragments. Rails' caching mechanism works great for storing <strong>any</strong> kind of information.</p>

<p>The most efficient way to implement low-level caching is using the <code>Rails.cache.fetch</code> method. This method does both reading and writing to the cache. When passed only a single argument, the key is fetched and value from the cache is returned. If a block is passed, that block will be executed in the event of a cache miss. The return value of the block will be written to the cache under the given cache key, and that return value will be returned. In case of cache hit, the cached value will be returned without executing the block.</p>

<p>Consider the following example. An application has a <code>Product</code> model with an instance method that looks up the product's price on a competing website. The data returned by this method would be perfect for low-level caching:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Product &lt; ApplicationRecord
  def competing_price
    Rails.cache.fetch("#{cache_key_with_version}/competing_price", expires_in: 12.hours) do
      Competitor::API.find_price(id)
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>Notice that in this example we used the <code>cache_key_with_version</code> method, so the resulting cache key will be something like <code>products/233-20140225082222765838000/competing_price</code>. <code>cache_key_with_version</code> generates a string based on the model's <code>id</code> and <code>updated_at</code> attributes. This is a common convention and has the benefit of invalidating the cache whenever the product is updated. In general, when you use low-level caching for instance level information, you need to generate a cache key.</p></div>

<h4 id="sql-caching"><a class="anchorlink" href="#sql-caching">1.8 SQL Caching</a></h4>

<p>Query caching is a Rails feature that caches the result set returned by each
query. If Rails encounters the same query again for that request, it will use
the cached result set as opposed to running the query against the database
again.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ProductsController &lt; ApplicationController

  def index
    # Run a find query
    @products = Product.all

    ...

    # Run the same query again
    @products = Product.all
  end

end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The second time the same query is run against the database, it's not actually going to hit the database. The first time the result is returned from the query it is stored in the query cache (in memory) and the second time it's pulled from memory.</p>

<p>However, it's important to note that query caches are created at the start of
an action and destroyed at the end of that action and thus persist only for the
duration of the action. If you'd like to store query results in a more
persistent fashion, you can with low level caching.</p>
