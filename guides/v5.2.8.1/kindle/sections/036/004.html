<h3 id="load-interlock"><a class="anchorlink" href="#load-interlock">5 Load Interlock</a></h3>
<p>The Load Interlock allows autoloading and reloading to be enabled in a
multi-threaded runtime environment.</p>

<p>When one thread is performing an autoload by evaluating the class definition
from the appropriate file, it is important no other thread encounters a
reference to the partially-defined constant.</p>

<p>Similarly, it is only safe to perform an unload/reload when no application code
is in mid-execution: after the reload, the <code>User</code> constant, for example, may
point to a different class. Without this rule, a poorly-timed reload would mean
<code>User.new.class == User</code>, or even <code>User == User</code>, could be false.</p>

<p>Both of these constraints are addressed by the Load Interlock. It keeps track of
which threads are currently running application code, loading a class, or
unloading autoloaded constants.</p>

<p>Only one thread may load or unload at a time, and to do either, it must wait
until no other threads are running application code. If a thread is waiting to
perform a load, it doesn't prevent other threads from loading (in fact, they'll
cooperate, and each perform their queued load in turn, before all resuming
running together).</p>

<h4 id="permit-concurrent-loads"><a class="anchorlink" href="#permit-concurrent-loads">5.1 <code>permit_concurrent_loads</code></a></h4>

<p>The Executor automatically acquires a <code>running</code> lock for the duration of its
block, and autoload knows when to upgrade to a <code>load</code> lock, and switch back to
<code>running</code> again afterwards.</p>

<p>Other blocking operations performed inside the Executor block (which includes
all application code), however, can needlessly retain the <code>running</code> lock. If
another thread encounters a constant it must autoload, this can cause a
deadlock.</p>

<p>For example, assuming <code>User</code> is not yet loaded, the following will deadlock:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.executor.wrap do
  th = Thread.new do
    Rails.application.executor.wrap do
      User # inner thread waits here; it cannot load
           # User while another thread is running
    end
  end

  th.join # outer thread waits here, holding 'running' lock
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>To prevent this deadlock, the outer thread can <code>permit_concurrent_loads</code>. By
calling this method, the thread guarantees it will not dereference any
possibly-autoloaded constant inside the supplied block. The safest way to meet
that promise is to put it as close as possible to the blocking call:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.executor.wrap do
  th = Thread.new do
    Rails.application.executor.wrap do
      User # inner thread can acquire the 'load' lock,
           # load User, and continue
    end
  end

  ActiveSupport::Dependencies.interlock.permit_concurrent_loads do
    th.join # outer thread waits here, but has no lock
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Another example, using Concurrent Ruby:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.executor.wrap do
  futures = 3.times.collect do |i|
    Concurrent::Future.execute do
      Rails.application.executor.wrap do
        # do work here
      end
    end
  end

  values = ActiveSupport::Dependencies.interlock.permit_concurrent_loads do
    futures.collect(&amp;:value)
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="actiondispatch-debuglocks"><a class="anchorlink" href="#actiondispatch-debuglocks">5.2 ActionDispatch::DebugLocks</a></h4>

<p>If your application is deadlocking and you think the Load Interlock may be
involved, you can temporarily add the ActionDispatch::DebugLocks middleware to
<code>config/application.rb</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.middleware.insert_before Rack::Sendfile,
                                  ActionDispatch::DebugLocks

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you then restart the application and re-trigger the deadlock condition,
<code>/rails/locks</code> will show a summary of all threads currently known to the
interlock, which lock level they are holding or awaiting, and their current
backtrace.</p>

<p>Generally a deadlock will be caused by the interlock conflicting with some other
external lock or blocking I/O call. Once you find it, you can wrap it with
<code>permit_concurrent_loads</code>.</p>
