<p>Like the Executor, the Reloader also wraps application code. If the Executor is
not already active on the current thread, the Reloader will invoke it for you,
so you only need to call one. This also guarantees that everything the Reloader
does, including all its callback invocations, occurs wrapped inside the
Executor.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.reloader.wrap do
  # call application code here
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The Reloader is only suitable where a long-running framework-level process
repeatedly calls into application code, such as for a web server or job queue.
Rails automatically wraps web requests and Active Job workers, so you'll rarely
need to invoke the Reloader for yourself. Always consider whether the Executor
is a better fit for your use case.</p>

<h4 id="callbacks"><a class="anchorlink" href="#callbacks">3.1 Callbacks</a></h4>

<p>Before entering the wrapped block, the Reloader will check whether the running
application needs to be reloaded -- for example, because a model's source file has
been modified. If it determines a reload is required, it will wait until it's
safe, and then do so, before continuing. When the application is configured to
always reload regardless of whether any changes are detected, the reload is
instead performed at the end of the block.</p>

<p>The Reloader also provides <code>to_run</code> and <code>to_complete</code> callbacks; they are
invoked at the same points as those of the Executor, but only when the current
execution has initiated an application reload. When no reload is deemed
necessary, the Reloader will invoke the wrapped block with no other callbacks.</p>

<h4 id="class-unload"><a class="anchorlink" href="#class-unload">3.2 Class Unload</a></h4>

<p>The most significant part of the reloading process is the Class Unload, where
all autoloaded classes are removed, ready to be loaded again. This will occur
immediately before either the Run or Complete callback, depending on the
<code>reload_classes_only_on_change</code> setting.</p>

<p>Often, additional reloading actions need to be performed either just before or
just after the Class Unload, so the Reloader also provides <code>before_class_unload</code>
and <code>after_class_unload</code> callbacks.</p>

<h4 id="reloader-concurrency"><a class="anchorlink" href="#reloader-concurrency">3.3 Concurrency</a></h4>

<p>Only long-running "top level" processes should invoke the Reloader, because if
it determines a reload is needed, it will block until all other threads have
completed any Executor invocations.</p>

<p>If this were to occur in a "child" thread, with a waiting parent inside the
Executor, it would cause an unavoidable deadlock: the reload must occur before
the child thread is executed, but it cannot be safely performed while the parent
thread is mid-execution. Child threads should use the Executor instead.</p>
