<h3 id="in-production">4 In Production</h3>
<p>In the production environment Sprockets uses the fingerprinting scheme outlined
above. By default Rails assumes assets have been precompiled and will be
served as static assets by your web server.</p>
<p>During the precompilation phase an MD5 is generated from the contents of the
compiled files, and inserted into the filenames as they are written to disc.
These fingerprinted names are used by the Rails helpers in place of the manifest
name.</p>
<p>For example this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "application" %&gt;
&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag "application" %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>generates something like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;script src="/assets/application-908e25f4bf641868d8683022a5b62f54.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link href="/assets/application-4dd5b109ee3439da54f5bdfd78a80473.css" media="screen"
rel="stylesheet" /&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Note: with the Asset Pipeline the :cache and :concat options aren't used
anymore, delete these options from the <code>javascript_include_tag</code> and
<code>stylesheet_link_tag</code>.</p>
<p>The fingerprinting behavior is controlled by the <code>config.assets.digest</code>
initialization option (which defaults to <code>true</code> for production and <code>false</code> for
everything else).</p>
<div class="note"><p>Under normal circumstances the default <code>config.assets.digest</code> option
should not be changed. If there are no digests in the filenames, and far-future
headers are set, remote clients will never know to refetch the files when their
content changes.</p></div>
<h4 id="precompiling-assets">4.1 Precompiling Assets</h4>
<p>Rails comes bundled with a rake task to compile the asset manifests and other
files in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Compiled assets are written to the location specified in <code>config.assets.prefix</code>.
By default, this is the <code>/assets</code> directory.</p>
<p>You can call this task on the server during deployment to create compiled
versions of your assets directly on the server. See the next section for
information on compiling locally.</p>
<p>The rake task is:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ RAILS_ENV=production bin/rake assets:precompile

</pre>
</div>
<p>Capistrano (v2.15.1 and above) includes a recipe to handle this in deployment.
Add the following line to <code>Capfile</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
load 'deploy/assets'

</pre>
</div>
<p>This links the folder specified in <code>config.assets.prefix</code> to <code>shared/assets</code>.
If you already use this shared folder you'll need to write your own deployment
task.</p>
<p>It is important that this folder is shared between deployments so that remotely
cached pages referencing the old compiled assets still work for the life of
the cached page.</p>
<p>The default matcher for compiling files includes <code>application.js</code>,
<code>application.css</code> and all non-JS/CSS files (this will include all image assets
automatically) from <code>app/assets</code> folders including your gems:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
[ Proc.new { |path, fn| fn =~ /app\/assets/ &amp;&amp; !%w(.js .css).include?(File.extname(path)) },
/application.(css|js)$/ ]

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>The matcher (and other members of the precompile array; see below) is
applied to final compiled file names. This means anything that compiles to
JS/CSS is excluded, as well as raw JS/CSS files; for example, <code>.coffee</code> and
<code>.scss</code> files are <strong>not</strong> automatically included as they compile to JS/CSS.</p></div>
<p>If you have other manifests or individual stylesheets and JavaScript files to
include, you can add them to the <code>precompile</code> array in <code>config/initializers/assets.rb</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += ['admin.js', 'admin.css', 'swfObject.js']

</pre>
</div>
<p>Or, you can opt to precompile all assets with something like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# config/initializers/assets.rb
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile &lt;&lt; Proc.new do |path|
  if path =~ /\.(css|js)\z/
    full_path = Rails.application.assets.resolve(path).to_path
    app_assets_path = Rails.root.join('app', 'assets').to_path
    if full_path.starts_with? app_assets_path
      puts "including asset: " + full_path
      true
    else
      puts "excluding asset: " + full_path
      false
    end
  else
    false
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>Always specify an expected compiled filename that ends with .js or .css,
even if you want to add Sass or CoffeeScript files to the precompile array.</p></div>
<p>The rake task also generates a <code>manifest-md5hash.json</code> that contains a list with
all your assets and their respective fingerprints. This is used by the Rails
helper methods to avoid handing the mapping requests back to Sprockets. A
typical manifest file looks like:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
{"files":{"application-723d1be6cc741a3aabb1cec24276d681.js":{"logical_path":"application.js","mtime":"2013-07-26T22:55:03-07:00","size":302506,

</pre>
</div>
<p>The default location for the manifest is the root of the location specified in
<code>config.assets.prefix</code> ('/assets' by default).</p>
<div class="note"><p>If there are missing precompiled files in production you will get an
<code>Sprockets::Helpers::RailsHelper::AssetPaths::AssetNotPrecompiledError</code>
exception indicating the name of the missing file(s).</p></div>
<h5 id="far-future-expires-header">4.1.1 Far-future Expires Header</h5>
<p>Precompiled assets exist on the filesystem and are served directly by your web
server. They do not have far-future headers by default, so to get the benefit of
fingerprinting you'll have to update your server configuration to add those
headers.</p>
<p>For Apache:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# The Expires* directives requires the Apache module
# `mod_expires` to be enabled.
&lt;Location /assets/&gt;
  # Use of ETag is discouraged when Last-Modified is present
  Header unset ETag
  FileETag None
  # RFC says only cache for 1 year
  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
&lt;/Location&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>For nginx:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
location ~ ^/assets/ {
  expires 1y;
  add_header Cache-Control public;

  add_header ETag "";
  break;
}

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="gzip-compression">4.1.2 GZip Compression</h5>
<p>When files are precompiled, Sprockets also creates a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzipped</a> (.gz) version of your assets. Web
servers are typically configured to use a moderate compression ratio as a
compromise, but since precompilation happens once, Sprockets uses the maximum
compression ratio, thus reducing the size of the data transfer to the minimum.
On the other hand, web servers can be configured to serve compressed content
directly from disk, rather than deflating non-compressed files themselves.</p>
<p>Nginx is able to do this automatically enabling <code>gzip_static</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
location ~ ^/(assets)/  {
  root /path/to/public;
  gzip_static on; # to serve pre-gzipped version
  expires max;
  add_header Cache-Control public;
}

</pre>
</div>
<p>This directive is available if the core module that provides this feature was
compiled with the web server. Ubuntu/Debian packages, even <code>nginx-light</code>, have
the module compiled. Otherwise, you may need to perform a manual compilation:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
./configure --with-http_gzip_static_module

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you're compiling nginx with Phusion Passenger you'll need to pass that option
when prompted.</p>
<p>A robust configuration for Apache is possible but tricky; please Google around.
(Or help update this Guide if you have a good configuration example for Apache.)</p>
<h4 id="local-precompilation">4.2 Local Precompilation</h4>
<p>There are several reasons why you might want to precompile your assets locally.
Among them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not have write access to your production file system.</li>
<li>You may be deploying to more than one server, and want to avoid
duplication of work.</li>
<li>You may be doing frequent deploys that do not include asset changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Local compilation allows you to commit the compiled files into source control,
and deploy as normal.</p>
<p>There are two caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must not run the Capistrano deployment task that precompiles assets.</li>
<li>You must change the following two application configuration settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>config/environments/development.rb</code>, place the following line:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.assets.prefix = "/dev-assets"

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>prefix</code> change makes Sprockets use a different URL for serving assets in
development mode, and pass all requests to Sprockets. The prefix is still set to
<code>/assets</code> in the production environment. Without this change, the application
would serve the precompiled assets from <code>/assets</code> in development, and you would
not see any local changes until you compile assets again.</p>
<p>You will also need to ensure any necessary compressors or minifiers are
available on your development system.</p>
<p>In practice, this will allow you to precompile locally, have those files in your
working tree, and commit those files to source control when needed.  Development
mode will work as expected.</p>
<h4 id="live-compilation">4.3 Live Compilation</h4>
<p>In some circumstances you may wish to use live compilation. In this mode all
requests for assets in the pipeline are handled by Sprockets directly.</p>
<p>To enable this option set:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.assets.compile = true

</pre>
</div>
<p>On the first request the assets are compiled and cached as outlined in
development above, and the manifest names used in the helpers are altered to
include the MD5 hash.</p>
<p>Sprockets also sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header to <code>max-age=31536000</code>. This
signals all caches between your server and the client browser that this content
(the file served) can be cached for 1 year. The effect of this is to reduce the
number of requests for this asset from your server; the asset has a good chance
of being in the local browser cache or some intermediate cache.</p>
<p>This mode uses more memory, performs more poorly than the default and is not
recommended.</p>
<p>If you are deploying a production application to a system without any
pre-existing JavaScript runtimes, you may want to add one to your Gemfile:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
group :production do
  gem 'therubyracer'
end

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="cdns">4.4 CDNs</h4>
<p>If your assets are being served by a CDN, ensure they don't stick around in your
cache forever. This can cause problems. If you use
<code>config.action_controller.perform_caching = true</code>, Rack::Cache will use
<code>Rails.cache</code> to store assets. This can cause your cache to fill up quickly.</p>
<p>Every cache is different, so evaluate how your CDN handles caching and make sure
that it plays nicely with the pipeline. You may find quirks related to your
specific set up, you may not. The defaults nginx uses, for example, should give
you no problems when used as an HTTP cache.</p>
