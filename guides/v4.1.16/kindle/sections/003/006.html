<h3 id="schema-dumping-and-you">7 Schema Dumping and You</h3>
<h4 id="what-are-schema-files-for-questionmark">7.1 What are Schema Files for?</h4>
<p>Migrations, mighty as they may be, are not the authoritative source for your
database schema. That role falls to either <code>db/schema.rb</code> or an SQL file which
Active Record generates by examining the database. They are not designed to be
edited, they just represent the current state of the database.</p>
<p>There is no need (and it is error prone) to deploy a new instance of an app by
replaying the entire migration history. It is much simpler and faster to just
load into the database a description of the current schema.</p>
<p>For example, this is how the test database is created: the current development
database is dumped (either to <code>db/schema.rb</code> or <code>db/structure.sql</code>) and then
loaded into the test database.</p>
<p>Schema files are also useful if you want a quick look at what attributes an
Active Record object has. This information is not in the model's code and is
frequently spread across several migrations, but the information is nicely
summed up in the schema file. The
<a href="https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models">annotate_models</a> gem automatically
adds and updates comments at the top of each model summarizing the schema if
you desire that functionality.</p>
<h4 id="types-of-schema-dumps">7.2 Types of Schema Dumps</h4>
<p>There are two ways to dump the schema. This is set in <code>config/application.rb</code>
by the <code>config.active_record.schema_format</code> setting, which may be either <code>:sql</code>
or <code>:ruby</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>:ruby</code> is selected then the schema is stored in <code>db/schema.rb</code>. If you look
at this file you'll find that it looks an awful lot like one very big
migration:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 20080906171750) do
  create_table "authors", force: true do |t|
    t.string   "name"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
  end

  create_table "products", force: true do |t|
    t.string   "name"
    t.text "description"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
    t.string "part_number"
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>In many ways this is exactly what it is. This file is created by inspecting the
database and expressing its structure using <code>create_table</code>, <code>add_index</code>, and so
on. Because this is database-independent, it could be loaded into any database
that Active Record supports. This could be very useful if you were to
distribute an application that is able to run against multiple databases.</p>
<p>There is however a trade-off: <code>db/schema.rb</code> cannot express database specific
items such as foreign key constraints, triggers, or stored procedures. While in
a migration you can execute custom SQL statements, the schema dumper cannot
reconstitute those statements from the database. If you are using features like
this, then you should set the schema format to <code>:sql</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of using Active Record's schema dumper, the database's structure will
be dumped using a tool specific to the database (via the <code>db:structure:dump</code>
Rake task) into <code>db/structure.sql</code>. For example, for PostgreSQL, the <code>pg_dump</code>
utility is used. For MySQL, this file will contain the output of
<code>SHOW CREATE TABLE</code> for the various tables.</p>
<p>Loading these schemas is simply a question of executing the SQL statements they
contain. By definition, this will create a perfect copy of the database's
structure. Using the <code>:sql</code> schema format will, however, prevent loading the
schema into a RDBMS other than the one used to create it.</p>
<h4 id="schema-dumps-and-source-control">7.3 Schema Dumps and Source Control</h4>
<p>Because schema dumps are the authoritative source for your database schema, it
is strongly recommended that you check them into source control.</p>
