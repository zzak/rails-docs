<h3 id="general-advice">1 General Advice</h3>
<p>Before attempting to upgrade an existing application, you should be sure you have a good reason to upgrade. You need to balance out several factors: the need for new features, the increasing difficulty of finding support for old code, and your available time and skills, to name a few.</p>
<h4 id="test-coverage">1.1 Test Coverage</h4>
<p>The best way to be sure that your application still works after upgrading is to have good test coverage before you start the process. If you don't have automated tests that exercise the bulk of your application, you'll need to spend time manually exercising all the parts that have changed. In the case of a Rails upgrade, that will mean every single piece of functionality in the application. Do yourself a favor and make sure your test coverage is good <em>before</em> you start an upgrade.</p>
<h4 id="ruby-versions">1.2 Ruby Versions</h4>
<p>Rails generally stays close to the latest released Ruby version when it's released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rails 3 and above require Ruby 1.8.7 or higher. Support for all of the previous Ruby versions has been dropped officially. You should upgrade as early as possible.</li>
<li>Rails 3.2.x is the last branch to support Ruby 1.8.7.</li>
<li>Rails 4 prefers Ruby 2.0 and requires 1.9.3 or newer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="info"><p>Ruby 1.8.7 p248 and p249 have marshaling bugs that crash Rails. Ruby Enterprise Edition has these fixed since the release of 1.8.7-2010.02. On the 1.9 front, Ruby 1.9.1 is not usable because it outright segfaults, so if you want to use 1.9.x, jump straight to 1.9.3 for smooth sailing.</p></div>
