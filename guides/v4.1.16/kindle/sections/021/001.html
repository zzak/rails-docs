<h3 id="cache-stores">2 Cache Stores</h3>
<p>Rails provides different stores for the cached data created by <b>action</b> and <b>fragment</b> caches.</p>
<div class="info"><p>Page caches are always stored on disk.</p></div>
<h4 id="configuration">2.1 Configuration</h4>
<p>You can set up your application's default cache store by calling <code>config.cache_store=</code> in the Application definition inside your <code>config/application.rb</code> file or in an Application.configure block in an environment specific configuration file (i.e. <code>config/environments/*.rb</code>). The first argument will be the cache store to use and the rest of the argument will be passed as arguments to the cache store constructor.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.cache_store = :memory_store

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>Alternatively, you can call <code>ActionController::Base.cache_store</code> outside of a configuration block.</p></div>
<p>You can access the cache by calling <code>Rails.cache</code>.</p>
<h4 id="activesupport-cache-store">2.2 ActiveSupport::Cache::Store</h4>
<p>This class provides the foundation for interacting with the cache in Rails. This is an abstract class and you cannot use it on its own. Rather you must use a concrete implementation of the class tied to a storage engine. Rails ships with several implementations documented below.</p>
<p>The main methods to call are <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>exist?</code>, and <code>fetch</code>. The fetch method takes a block and will either return an existing value from the cache, or evaluate the block and write the result to the cache if no value exists.</p>
<p>There are some common options used by all cache implementations. These can be passed to the constructor or the various methods to interact with entries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>:namespace</code> - This option can be used to create a namespace within the cache store. It is especially useful if your application shares a cache with other applications.</li>
<li>
<code>:compress</code> - This option can be used to indicate that compression should be used in the cache. This can be useful for transferring large cache entries over a slow network.</li>
<li>
<code>:compress_threshold</code> - This options is used in conjunction with the <code>:compress</code> option to indicate a threshold under which cache entries should not be compressed. This defaults to 16 kilobytes.</li>
<li>
<code>:expires_in</code> - This option sets an expiration time in seconds for the cache entry when it will be automatically removed from the cache.</li>
<li>
<code>:race_condition_ttl</code> - This option is used in conjunction with the <code>:expires_in</code> option. It will prevent race conditions when cache entries expire by preventing multiple processes from simultaneously regenerating the same entry (also known as the dog pile effect). This option sets the number of seconds that an expired entry can be reused while a new value is being regenerated. It's a good practice to set this value if you use the <code>:expires_in</code> option.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="activesupport-cache-memorystore">2.3 ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore</h4>
<p>This cache store keeps entries in memory in the same Ruby process. The cache store has a bounded size specified by the <code>:size</code> options to the initializer (default is 32Mb). When the cache exceeds the allotted size, a cleanup will occur and the least recently used entries will be removed.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.cache_store = :memory_store, { size: 64.megabytes }

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you're running multiple Ruby on Rails server processes (which is the case if you're using mongrel_cluster or Phusion Passenger), then your Rails server process instances won't be able to share cache data with each other. This cache store is not appropriate for large application deployments, but can work well for small, low traffic sites with only a couple of server processes or for development and test environments.</p>
<h4 id="activesupport-cache-filestore">2.4 ActiveSupport::Cache::FileStore</h4>
<p>This cache store uses the file system to store entries. The path to the directory where the store files will be stored must be specified when initializing the cache.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.cache_store = :file_store, "/path/to/cache/directory"

</pre>
</div>
<p>With this cache store, multiple server processes on the same host can share a cache. Servers processes running on different hosts could share a cache by using a shared file system, but that set up would not be ideal and is not recommended. The cache store is appropriate for low to medium traffic sites that are served off one or two hosts.</p>
<p>Note that the cache will grow until the disk is full unless you periodically clear out old entries.</p>
<p>This is the default cache store implementation.</p>
<h4 id="activesupport-cache-memcachestore">2.5 ActiveSupport::Cache::MemCacheStore</h4>
<p>This cache store uses Danga's <code>memcached</code> server to provide a centralized cache for your application. Rails uses the bundled <code>dalli</code> gem by default. This is currently the most popular cache store for production websites. It can be used to provide a single, shared cache cluster with very high performance and redundancy.</p>
<p>When initializing the cache, you need to specify the addresses for all memcached servers in your cluster. If none is specified, it will assume memcached is running on the local host on the default port, but this is not an ideal set up for larger sites.</p>
<p>The <code>write</code> and <code>fetch</code> methods on this cache accept two additional options that take advantage of features specific to memcached. You can specify <code>:raw</code> to send a value directly to the server with no serialization. The value must be a string or number. You can use memcached direct operation like <code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> only on raw values. You can also specify <code>:unless_exist</code> if you don't want memcached to overwrite an existing entry.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, "cache-1.example.com", "cache-2.example.com"

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="activesupport-cache-ehcachestore">2.6 ActiveSupport::Cache::EhcacheStore</h4>
<p>If you are using JRuby you can use Terracotta's Ehcache as the cache store for your application. Ehcache is an open source Java cache that also offers an enterprise version with increased scalability, management, and commercial support. You must first install the jruby-ehcache-rails3 gem (version 1.1.0 or later) to use this cache store.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.cache_store = :ehcache_store

</pre>
</div>
<p>When initializing the cache, you may use the <code>:ehcache_config</code> option to specify the Ehcache config file to use (where the default is "ehcache.xml" in your Rails config directory), and the :cache_name option to provide a custom name for your cache (the default is rails_cache).</p>
<p>In addition to the standard <code>:expires_in</code> option, the <code>write</code> method on this cache can also accept the additional <code>:unless_exist</code> option, which will cause the cache store to use Ehcache's <code>putIfAbsent</code> method instead of <code>put</code>, and therefore will not overwrite an existing entry. Additionally, the <code>write</code> method supports all of the properties exposed by the <a href="http://ehcache.org/apidocs/net/sf/ehcache/Element.html">Ehcache Element class</a> , including:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Argument Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>elementEvictionData</td>
<td>ElementEvictionData</td>
<td>Sets this element's eviction data instance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eternal</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Sets whether the element is eternal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>timeToIdle, tti</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>Sets time to idle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>timeToLive, ttl, expires_in</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>Sets time to Live</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>version</td>
<td>long</td>
<td>Sets the version attribute of the ElementAttributes object.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These options are passed to the <code>write</code> method as Hash options using either camelCase or underscore notation, as in the following examples:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.cache.write('key', 'value', time_to_idle: 60.seconds, timeToLive: 600.seconds)
caches_action :index, expires_in: 60.seconds, unless_exist: true

</pre>
</div>

<h4 id="activesupport-cache-nullstore">2.7 ActiveSupport::Cache::NullStore</h4>
<p>This cache store implementation is meant to be used only in development or test environments and it never stores anything. This can be very useful in development when you have code that interacts directly with <code>Rails.cache</code>, but caching may interfere with being able to see the results of code changes. With this cache store, all <code>fetch</code> and <code>read</code> operations will result in a miss.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.cache_store = :null_store

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="custom-cache-stores">2.8 Custom Cache Stores</h4>
<p>You can create your own custom cache store by simply extending <code>ActiveSupport::Cache::Store</code> and implementing the appropriate methods. In this way, you can swap in any number of caching technologies into your Rails application.</p>
<p>To use a custom cache store, simple set the cache store to a new instance of the class.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.cache_store = MyCacheStore.new

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="cache-keys">2.9 Cache Keys</h4>
<p>The keys used in a cache can be any object that responds to either <code>:cache_key</code> or to <code>:to_param</code>. You can implement the <code>:cache_key</code> method on your classes if you need to generate custom keys. Active Record will generate keys based on the class name and record id.</p>
<p>You can use Hashes and Arrays of values as cache keys.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# This is a legal cache key
Rails.cache.read(site: "mysite", owners: [owner_1, owner_2])

</pre>
</div>
<p>The keys you use on <code>Rails.cache</code> will not be the same as those actually used with the storage engine. They may be modified with a namespace or altered to fit technology backend constraints. This means, for instance, that you can't save values with <code>Rails.cache</code> and then try to pull them out with the <code>memcache-client</code> gem. However, you also don't need to worry about exceeding the memcached size limit or violating syntax rules.</p>
