<p>For each controller there is an associated directory in the <code>app/views</code> directory which holds the template files that make up the views associated with that controller. These files are used to display the view that results from each controller action.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what Rails does by default when creating a new resource using the scaffold generator:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rails generate scaffold post
      [...]
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/posts
      create      app/views/posts/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/_form.html.erb
      [...]

</pre>
</div>
<p>There is a naming convention for views in Rails. Typically, the views share their name with the associated controller action, as you can see above.
For example, the index controller action of the <code>posts_controller.rb</code> will use the <code>index.html.erb</code> view file in the <code>app/views/posts</code> directory.
The complete HTML returned to the client is composed of a combination of this ERB file, a layout template that wraps it, and all the partials that the view may reference. Later on this guide you can find a more detailed documentation of each one of these three components.</p>
