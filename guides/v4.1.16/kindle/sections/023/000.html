<p>In order to understand Ajax, you must first understand what a web browser does
normally.</p>
<p>When you type <code>http://localhost:3000</code> into your browser's address bar and hit
'Go,' the browser (your 'client') makes a request to the server. It parses the
response, then fetches all associated assets, like JavaScript files,
stylesheets and images. It then assembles the page. If you click a link, it
does the same process: fetch the page, fetch the assets, put it all together,
show you the results. This is called the 'request response cycle.'</p>
<p>JavaScript can also make requests to the server, and parse the response. It
also has the ability to update information on the page. Combining these two
powers, a JavaScript writer can make a web page that can update just parts of
itself, without needing to get the full page data from the server. This is a
powerful technique that we call Ajax.</p>
<p>Rails ships with CoffeeScript by default, and so the rest of the examples
in this guide will be in CoffeeScript. All of these lessons, of course, apply
to vanilla JavaScript as well.</p>
<p>As an example, here's some CoffeeScript code that makes an Ajax request using
the jQuery library:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$.ajax(url: "/test").done (html) -&gt;
  $("#results").append html

</pre>
</div>
<p>This code fetches data from "/test", and then appends the result to the <code>div</code>
with an id of <code>results</code>.</p>
<p>Rails provides quite a bit of built-in support for building web pages with this
technique. You rarely have to write this code yourself. The rest of this guide
will show you how Rails can help you write websites in this way, but it's
all built on top of this fairly simple technique.</p>
