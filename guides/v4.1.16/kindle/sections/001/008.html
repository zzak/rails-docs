<h4 id="basic-authentication">9.1 Basic Authentication</h4>
<p>If you were to publish your blog online, anybody would be able to add, edit and
delete articles or delete comments.</p>
<p>Rails provides a very simple HTTP authentication system that will work nicely in
this situation.</p>
<p>In the <code>ArticlesController</code> we need to have a way to block access to the various
actions if the person is not authenticated, here we can use the Rails
<code>http_basic_authenticate_with</code> method, allowing access to the requested
action if that method allows it.</p>
<p>To use the authentication system, we specify it at the top of our
<code>ArticlesController</code>, in this case, we want the user to be authenticated on
every action, except for <code>index</code> and <code>show</code>, so we write that in
<code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class ArticlesController &lt; ApplicationController

  http_basic_authenticate_with name: "dhh", password: "secret", except: [:index, :show]

  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  # snipped for brevity

</pre>
</div>
<p>We also want to allow only authenticated users to delete comments, so in the
<code>CommentsController</code> (<code>app/controllers/comments_controller.rb</code>) we write:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class CommentsController &lt; ApplicationController

  http_basic_authenticate_with name: "dhh", password: "secret", only: :destroy

  def create
    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
    ...
  end

  # snipped for brevity

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now if you try to create a new article, you will be greeted with a basic HTTP
Authentication challenge</p>

<p>Other authentication methods are available for Rails applications. Two popular
authentication add-ons for Rails are the
<a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> rails engine and
the <a href="https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">Authlogic</a> gem,
along with a number of others.</p>
