<p>The easiest way to work with Rails is to store all external data as UTF-8. If
you don't, Ruby libraries and Rails will often be able to convert your native
data into UTF-8, but this doesn't always work reliably, so you're better off
ensuring that all external data is UTF-8.</p>
<p>If you have made a mistake in this area, the most common symptom is a black
diamond with a question mark inside appearing in the browser. Another common
symptom is characters like "Ã¼" appearing instead of "ü". Rails takes a number
of internal steps to mitigate common causes of these problems that can be
automatically detected and corrected. However, if you have external data that is
not stored as UTF-8, it can occasionally result in these kinds of issues that
cannot be automatically detected by Rails and corrected.</p>
<p>Two very common sources of data that are not UTF-8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your text editor: Most text editors (such as TextMate), default to saving
files as UTF-8. If your text editor does not, this can result in special
characters that you enter in your templates (such as é) to appear as a diamond
with a question mark inside in the browser. This also applies to your i18n
translation files. Most editors that do not already default to UTF-8 (such as
some versions of Dreamweaver) offer a way to change the default to UTF-8. Do
so.</li>
<li>Your database: Rails defaults to converting data from your database into UTF-8
at the boundary. However, if your database is not using UTF-8 internally, it
may not be able to store all characters that your users enter. For instance,
if your database is using Latin-1 internally, and your user enters a Russian,
Hebrew, or Japanese character, the data will be lost forever once it enters
the database. If possible, use UTF-8 as the internal storage of your database.</li>
</ul>
