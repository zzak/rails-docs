<h3 id="why-associations-questionmark">1 Why Associations?</h3>
<p>Why do we need associations between models? Because they make common operations simpler and easier in your code. For example, consider a simple Rails application that includes a model for customers and a model for orders. Each customer can have many orders. Without associations, the model declarations would look like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

class Order &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now, suppose we wanted to add a new order for an existing customer. We'd need to do something like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@order = Order.create(order_date: Time.now, customer_id: @customer.id)

</pre>
</div>
<p>Or consider deleting a customer, and ensuring that all of its orders get deleted as well:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@orders = Order.where(customer_id: @customer.id)
@orders.each do |order|
  order.destroy
end
@customer.destroy

</pre>
</div>
<p>With Active Record associations, we can streamline these - and other - operations by declaratively telling Rails that there is a connection between the two models. Here's the revised code for setting up customers and orders:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :orders, dependent: :destroy
end

class Order &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :customer
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>With this change, creating a new order for a particular customer is easier:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@order = @customer.orders.create(order_date: Time.now)

</pre>
</div>
<p>Deleting a customer and all of its orders is <em>much</em> easier:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
@customer.destroy

</pre>
</div>
