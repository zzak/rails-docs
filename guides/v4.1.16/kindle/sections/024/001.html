<h3 id="generating-an-engine">2 Generating an engine</h3>
<p>To generate an engine, you will need to run the plugin generator and pass it
options as appropriate to the need. For the "blorgh" example, you will need to
create a "mountable" engine, running this command in a terminal:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rails plugin new blorgh --mountable

</pre>
</div>
<p>The full list of options for the plugin generator may be seen by typing:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rails plugin --help

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>--full</code> option tells the generator that you want to create an engine,
including a skeleton structure that provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>app</code> directory tree</li>
<li>
A <code>config/routes.rb</code> file:
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.routes.draw do
end

</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>A file at <code>lib/blorgh/engine.rb</code>, which is identical in function to a</li>
<li>
standard Rails application's <code>config/application.rb</code> file:
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module Blorgh
  class Engine &lt; ::Rails::Engine
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>--mountable</code> option tells the generator that you want to create a
"mountable" and namespace-isolated engine. This generator will provide the same
skeleton structure as would the <code>--full</code> option, and will add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asset manifest files (<code>application.js</code> and <code>application.css</code>)</li>
<li>A namespaced <code>ApplicationController</code> stub</li>
<li>A namespaced <code>ApplicationHelper</code> stub</li>
<li>A layout view template for the engine</li>
<li>
Namespace isolation to <code>config/routes.rb</code>:
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Blorgh::Engine.routes.draw do
end

</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>
Namespace isolation to <code>lib/blorgh/engine.rb</code>:
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module Blorgh
  class Engine &lt; ::Rails::Engine
    isolate_namespace Blorgh
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <code>--mountable</code> option tells the generator to mount the engine
inside the dummy testing application located at <code>test/dummy</code> by adding the
following to the dummy application's routes file at
<code>test/dummy/config/routes.rb</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
mount Blorgh::Engine, at: "blorgh"

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="inside-an-engine">2.1 Inside an Engine</h4>
<h5 id="critical-files">2.1.1 Critical Files</h5>
<p>At the root of this brand new engine's directory lives a <code>blorgh.gemspec</code> file.
When you include the engine into an application later on, you will do so with
this line in the Rails application's <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
gem 'blorgh', path: "vendor/engines/blorgh"

</pre>
</div>
<p>Don't forget to run <code>bundle install</code> as usual. By specifying it as a gem within
the <code>Gemfile</code>, Bundler will load it as such, parsing this <code>blorgh.gemspec</code> file
and requiring a file within the <code>lib</code> directory called <code>lib/blorgh.rb</code>. This
file requires the <code>blorgh/engine.rb</code> file (located at <code>lib/blorgh/engine.rb</code>)
and defines a base module called <code>Blorgh</code>.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require "blorgh/engine"

module Blorgh
end

</pre>
</div>
<div class="info"><p>Some engines choose to use this file to put global configuration options
for their engine. It's a relatively good idea, so if you want to offer
configuration options, the file where your engine's <code>module</code> is defined is
perfect for that. Place the methods inside the module and you'll be good to go.</p></div>
<p>Within <code>lib/blorgh/engine.rb</code> is the base class for the engine:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module Blorgh
  class Engine &lt; Rails::Engine
    isolate_namespace Blorgh
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>By inheriting from the <code>Rails::Engine</code> class, this gem notifies Rails that
there's an engine at the specified path, and will correctly mount the engine
inside the application, performing tasks such as adding the <code>app</code> directory of
the engine to the load path for models, mailers, controllers and views.</p>
<p>The <code>isolate_namespace</code> method here deserves special notice. This call is
responsible for isolating the controllers, models, routes and other things into
their own namespace, away from similar components inside the application.
Without this, there is a possibility that the engine's components could "leak"
into the application, causing unwanted disruption, or that important engine
components could be overridden by similarly named things within the application.
One of the examples of such conflicts is helpers. Without calling
<code>isolate_namespace</code>, the engine's helpers would be included in an application's
controllers.</p>
<div class="note"><p>It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that the <code>isolate_namespace</code> line be left
within the <code>Engine</code> class definition. Without it, classes generated in an engine
<strong>may</strong> conflict with an application.</p></div>
<p>What this isolation of the namespace means is that a model generated by a call
to <code>bin/rails g model</code>, such as <code>bin/rails g model post</code>, won't be called <code>Post</code>, but
instead be namespaced and called <code>Blorgh::Post</code>. In addition, the table for the
model is namespaced, becoming <code>blorgh_posts</code>, rather than simply <code>posts</code>.
Similar to the model namespacing, a controller called <code>PostsController</code> becomes
<code>Blorgh::PostsController</code> and the views for that controller will not be at
<code>app/views/posts</code>, but <code>app/views/blorgh/posts</code> instead. Mailers are namespaced
as well.</p>
<p>Finally, routes will also be isolated within the engine. This is one of the most
important parts about namespacing, and is discussed later in the
<a href="#routes">Routes</a> section of this guide.</p>
<h5 id="app-directory">2.1.2 <code>app</code> Directory</h5>
<p>Inside the <code>app</code> directory are the standard <code>assets</code>, <code>controllers</code>, <code>helpers</code>,
<code>mailers</code>, <code>models</code> and <code>views</code> directories that you should be familiar with
from an application. The <code>helpers</code>, <code>mailers</code> and <code>models</code> directories are
empty, so they aren't described in this section. We'll look more into models in
a future section, when we're writing the engine.</p>
<p>Within the <code>app/assets</code> directory, there are the <code>images</code>, <code>javascripts</code> and
<code>stylesheets</code> directories which, again, you should be familiar with due to their
similarity to an application. One difference here, however, is that each
directory contains a sub-directory with the engine name. Because this engine is
going to be namespaced, its assets should be too.</p>
<p>Within the <code>app/controllers</code> directory there is a <code>blorgh</code> directory that
contains a file called <code>application_controller.rb</code>. This file will provide any
common functionality for the controllers of the engine. The <code>blorgh</code> directory
is where the other controllers for the engine will go. By placing them within
this namespaced directory, you prevent them from possibly clashing with
identically-named controllers within other engines or even within the
application.</p>
<div class="note"><p>The <code>ApplicationController</code> class inside an engine is named just like a
Rails application in order to make it easier for you to convert your
applications into engines.</p></div>
<p>Lastly, the <code>app/views</code> directory contains a <code>layouts</code> folder, which contains a
file at <code>blorgh/application.html.erb</code>. This file allows you to specify a layout
for the engine. If this engine is to be used as a stand-alone engine, then you
would add any customization to its layout in this file, rather than the
application's <code>app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</code> file.</p>
<p>If you don't want to force a layout on to users of the engine, then you can
delete this file and reference a different layout in the controllers of your
engine.</p>
<h5 id="bin-directory">2.1.3 <code>bin</code> Directory</h5>
<p>This directory contains one file, <code>bin/rails</code>, which enables you to use the
<code>rails</code> sub-commands and generators just like you would within an application.
This means that you will be able to generate new controllers and models for this
engine very easily by running commands like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rails g model

</pre>
</div>
<p>Keep in mind, of course, that anything generated with these commands inside of
an engine that has <code>isolate_namespace</code> in the <code>Engine</code> class will be namespaced.</p>
<h5 id="test-directory">2.1.4 <code>test</code> Directory</h5>
<p>The <code>test</code> directory is where tests for the engine will go. To test the engine,
there is a cut-down version of a Rails application embedded within it at
<code>test/dummy</code>. This application will mount the engine in the
<code>test/dummy/config/routes.rb</code> file:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Blorgh::Engine =&gt; "/blorgh"
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This line mounts the engine at the path <code>/blorgh</code>, which will make it accessible
through the application only at that path.</p>
<p>Inside the test directory there is the <code>test/integration</code> directory, where
integration tests for the engine should be placed. Other directories can be
created in the <code>test</code> directory as well. For example, you may wish to create a
<code>test/models</code> directory for your model tests.</p>
