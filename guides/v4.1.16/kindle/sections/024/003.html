<h3 id="hooking-into-an-application">4 Hooking Into an Application</h3>
<p>Using an engine within an application is very easy. This section covers how to
mount the engine into an application and the initial setup required, as well as
linking the engine to a <code>User</code> class provided by the application to provide
ownership for posts and comments within the engine.</p>
<h4 id="mounting-the-engine">4.1 Mounting the Engine</h4>
<p>First, the engine needs to be specified inside the application's <code>Gemfile</code>. If
there isn't an application handy to test this out in, generate one using the
<code>rails new</code> command outside of the engine directory like this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ rails new unicorn

</pre>
</div>
<p>Usually, specifying the engine inside the Gemfile would be done by specifying it
as a normal, everyday gem.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
gem 'devise'

</pre>
</div>
<p>However, because you are developing the <code>blorgh</code> engine on your local machine,
you will need to specify the <code>:path</code> option in your <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
gem 'blorgh', path: "/path/to/blorgh"

</pre>
</div>
<p>Then run <code>bundle</code> to install the gem.</p>
<p>As described earlier, by placing the gem in the <code>Gemfile</code> it will be loaded when
Rails is loaded. It will first require <code>lib/blorgh.rb</code> from the engine, then
<code>lib/blorgh/engine.rb</code>, which is the file that defines the major pieces of
functionality for the engine.</p>
<p>To make the engine's functionality accessible from within an application, it
needs to be mounted in that application's <code>config/routes.rb</code> file:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
mount Blorgh::Engine, at: "/blog"

</pre>
</div>
<p>This line will mount the engine at <code>/blog</code> in the application. Making it
accessible at <code>http://localhost:3000/blog</code> when the application runs with <code>rails
server</code>.</p>
<div class="note"><p>Other engines, such as Devise, handle this a little differently by making
you specify custom helpers (such as <code>devise_for</code>) in the routes. These helpers
do exactly the same thing, mounting pieces of the engines's functionality at a
pre-defined path which may be customizable.</p></div>
<h4 id="engine-setup">4.2 Engine setup</h4>
<p>The engine contains migrations for the <code>blorgh_posts</code> and <code>blorgh_comments</code>
table which need to be created in the application's database so that the
engine's models can query them correctly. To copy these migrations into the
application use this command:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rake blorgh:install:migrations

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you have multiple engines that need migrations copied over, use
<code>railties:install:migrations</code> instead:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rake railties:install:migrations

</pre>
</div>
<p>This command, when run for the first time, will copy over all the migrations
from the engine. When run the next time, it will only copy over migrations that
haven't been copied over already. The first run for this command will output
something such as this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Copied migration [timestamp_1]_create_blorgh_posts.rb from blorgh
Copied migration [timestamp_2]_create_blorgh_comments.rb from blorgh

</pre>
</div>
<p>The first timestamp (<code>[timestamp_1]</code>) will be the current time, and the second
timestamp (<code>[timestamp_2]</code>) will be the current time plus a second. The reason
for this is so that the migrations for the engine are run after any existing
migrations in the application.</p>
<p>To run these migrations within the context of the application, simply run <code>rake
db:migrate</code>. When accessing the engine through <code>http://localhost:3000/blog</code>, the
posts will be empty. This is because the table created inside the application is
different from the one created within the engine. Go ahead, play around with the
newly mounted engine. You'll find that it's the same as when it was only an
engine.</p>
<p>If you would like to run migrations only from one engine, you can do it by
specifying <code>SCOPE</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
rake db:migrate SCOPE=blorgh

</pre>
</div>
<p>This may be useful if you want to revert engine's migrations before removing it.
To revert all migrations from blorgh engine you can run code such as:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
rake db:migrate SCOPE=blorgh VERSION=0

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="using-a-class-provided-by-the-application">4.3 Using a Class Provided by the Application</h4>
<h5 id="using-a-model-provided-by-the-application">4.3.1 Using a Model Provided by the Application</h5>
<p>When an engine is created, it may want to use specific classes from an
application to provide links between the pieces of the engine and the pieces of
the application. In the case of the <code>blorgh</code> engine, making posts and comments
have authors would make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>A typical application might have a <code>User</code> class that would be used to represent
authors for a post or a comment. But there could be a case where the application
calls this class something different, such as <code>Person</code>. For this reason, the
engine should not hardcode associations specifically for a <code>User</code> class.</p>
<p>To keep it simple in this case, the application will have a class called <code>User</code>
that represents the users of the application. It can be generated using this
command inside the application:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
rails g model user name:string

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>rake db:migrate</code> command needs to be run here to ensure that our
application has the <code>users</code> table for future use.</p>
<p>Also, to keep it simple, the posts form will have a new text field called
<code>author_name</code>, where users can elect to put their name. The engine will then
take this name and either create a new <code>User</code> object from it, or find one that
already has that name. The engine will then associate the post with the found or
created <code>User</code> object.</p>
<p>First, the <code>author_name</code> text field needs to be added to the
<code>app/views/blorgh/posts/_form.html.erb</code> partial inside the engine. This can be
added above the <code>title</code> field with this code:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;div class="field"&gt;
  &lt;%= f.label :author_name %&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :author_name %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Next, we need to update our <code>Blorgh::PostController#post_params</code> method to
permit the new form parameter:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
def post_params
  params.require(:post).permit(:title, :text, :author_name)
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>Blorgh::Post</code> model should then have some code to convert the <code>author_name</code>
field into an actual <code>User</code> object and associate it as that post's <code>author</code>
before the post is saved. It will also need to have an <code>attr_accessor</code> set up
for this field, so that the setter and getter methods are defined for it.</p>
<p>To do all this, you'll need to add the <code>attr_accessor</code> for <code>author_name</code>, the
association for the author and the <code>before_save</code> call into
<code>app/models/blorgh/post.rb</code>. The <code>author</code> association will be hard-coded to the
<code>User</code> class for the time being.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
attr_accessor :author_name
belongs_to :author, class_name: "User"

before_save :set_author

private
  def set_author
    self.author = User.find_or_create_by(name: author_name)
  end

</pre>
</div>
<p>By representing the <code>author</code> association's object with the <code>User</code> class, a link
is established between the engine and the application. There needs to be a way
of associating the records in the <code>blorgh_posts</code> table with the records in the
<code>users</code> table. Because the association is called <code>author</code>, there should be an
<code>author_id</code> column added to the <code>blorgh_posts</code> table.</p>
<p>To generate this new column, run this command within the engine:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rails g migration add_author_id_to_blorgh_posts author_id:integer

</pre>
</div>
<div class="note"><p>Due to the migration's name and the column specification after it, Rails
will automatically know that you want to add a column to a specific table and
write that into the migration for you. You don't need to tell it any more than
this.</p></div>
<p>This migration will need to be run on the application. To do that, it must first
be copied using this command:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rake blorgh:install:migrations

</pre>
</div>
<p>Notice that only <em>one</em> migration was copied over here. This is because the first
two migrations were copied over the first time this command was run.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
NOTE Migration [timestamp]_create_blorgh_posts.rb from blorgh has been
skipped. Migration with the same name already exists. NOTE Migration
[timestamp]_create_blorgh_comments.rb from blorgh has been skipped. Migration
with the same name already exists. Copied migration
[timestamp]_add_author_id_to_blorgh_posts.rb from blorgh

</pre>
</div>
<p>Run the migration using:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
$ bin/rake db:migrate

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now with all the pieces in place, an action will take place that will associate
an author - represented by a record in the <code>users</code> table - with a post,
represented by the <code>blorgh_posts</code> table from the engine.</p>
<p>Finally, the author's name should be displayed on the post's page. Add this code
above the "Title" output inside <code>app/views/blorgh/posts/show.html.erb</code>:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Author:&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;%= @post.author %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>By outputting <code>@post.author</code> using the <code>&lt;%=</code> tag, the <code>to_s</code> method will be
called on the object. By default, this will look quite ugly:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
#&lt;User:0x00000100ccb3b0&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>This is undesirable. It would be much better to have the user's name there. To
do this, add a <code>to_s</code> method to the <code>User</code> class within the application:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
def to_s
  name
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now instead of the ugly Ruby object output, the author's name will be displayed.</p>
<h5 id="using-a-controller-provided-by-the-application">4.3.2 Using a Controller Provided by the Application</h5>
<p>Because Rails controllers generally share code for things like authentication
and accessing session variables, they inherit from <code>ApplicationController</code> by
default. Rails engines, however are scoped to run independently from the main
application, so each engine gets a scoped <code>ApplicationController</code>. This
namespace prevents code collisions, but often engine controllers need to access
methods in the main application's <code>ApplicationController</code>. An easy way to
provide this access is to change the engine's scoped <code>ApplicationController</code> to
inherit from the main application's <code>ApplicationController</code>. For our Blorgh
engine this would be done by changing
<code>app/controllers/blorgh/application_controller.rb</code> to look like:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Blorgh::ApplicationController &lt; ApplicationController
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>By default, the engine's controllers inherit from
<code>Blorgh::ApplicationController</code>. So, after making this change they will have
access to the main application's <code>ApplicationController</code>, as though they were
part of the main application.</p>
<p>This change does require that the engine is run from a Rails application that
has an <code>ApplicationController</code>.</p>
<h4 id="configuring-an-engine">4.4 Configuring an Engine</h4>
<p>This section covers how to make the <code>User</code> class configurable, followed by
general configuration tips for the engine.</p>
<h5 id="setting-configuration-settings-in-the-application">4.4.1 Setting Configuration Settings in the Application</h5>
<p>The next step is to make the class that represents a <code>User</code> in the application
customizable for the engine. This is because that class may not always be
<code>User</code>, as previously explained. To make this setting customizable, the engine
will have a configuration setting called <code>author_class</code> that will be used to
specify which class represents users inside the application.</p>
<p>To define this configuration setting, you should use a <code>mattr_accessor</code> inside
the <code>Blorgh</code> module for the engine. Add this line to <code>lib/blorgh.rb</code> inside the
engine:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
mattr_accessor :author_class

</pre>
</div>
<p>This method works like its brothers, <code>attr_accessor</code> and <code>cattr_accessor</code>, but
provides a setter and getter method on the module with the specified name. To
use it, it must be referenced using <code>Blorgh.author_class</code>.</p>
<p>The next step is to switch the <code>Blorgh::Post</code> model over to this new setting.
Change the <code>belongs_to</code> association inside this model
(<code>app/models/blorgh/post.rb</code>) to this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
belongs_to :author, class_name: Blorgh.author_class

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>set_author</code> method in the <code>Blorgh::Post</code> model should also use this class:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
self.author = Blorgh.author_class.constantize.find_or_create_by(name: author_name)

</pre>
</div>
<p>To save having to call <code>constantize</code> on the <code>author_class</code> result all the time,
you could instead just override the <code>author_class</code> getter method inside the
<code>Blorgh</code> module in the <code>lib/blorgh.rb</code> file to always call <code>constantize</code> on the
saved value before returning the result:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
def self.author_class
  @@author_class.constantize
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This would then turn the above code for <code>set_author</code> into this:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
self.author = Blorgh.author_class.find_or_create_by(name: author_name)

</pre>
</div>
<p>Resulting in something a little shorter, and more implicit in its behavior. The
<code>author_class</code> method should always return a <code>Class</code> object.</p>
<p>Since we changed the <code>author_class</code> method to return a <code>Class</code> instead of a
<code>String</code>, we must also modify our <code>belongs_to</code> definition in the <code>Blorgh::Post</code>
model:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
belongs_to :author, class_name: Blorgh.author_class.to_s

</pre>
</div>
<p>To set this configuration setting within the application, an initializer should
be used. By using an initializer, the configuration will be set up before the
application starts and calls the engine's models, which may depend on this
configuration setting existing.</p>
<p>Create a new initializer at <code>config/initializers/blorgh.rb</code> inside the
application where the <code>blorgh</code> engine is installed and put this content in it:</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Blorgh.author_class = "User"

</pre>
</div>
<div class="warning"><p>It's very important here to use the <code>String</code> version of the class,
rather than the class itself. If you were to use the class, Rails would attempt
to load that class and then reference the related table. This could lead to
problems if the table wasn't already existing. Therefore, a <code>String</code> should be
used and then converted to a class using <code>constantize</code> in the engine later on.</p></div>
<p>Go ahead and try to create a new post. You will see that it works exactly in the
same way as before, except this time the engine is using the configuration
setting in <code>config/initializers/blorgh.rb</code> to learn what the class is.</p>
<p>There are now no strict dependencies on what the class is, only what the API for
the class must be. The engine simply requires this class to define a
<code>find_or_create_by</code> method which returns an object of that class, to be
associated with a post when it's created. This object, of course, should have
some sort of identifier by which it can be referenced.</p>
<h5 id="general-engine-configuration">4.4.2 General Engine Configuration</h5>
<p>Within an engine, there may come a time where you wish to use things such as
initializers, internationalization or other configuration options. The great
news is that these things are entirely possible, because a Rails engine shares
much the same functionality as a Rails application. In fact, a Rails
application's functionality is actually a superset of what is provided by
engines!</p>
<p>If you wish to use an initializer - code that should run before the engine is
loaded - the place for it is the <code>config/initializers</code> folder. This directory's
functionality is explained in the <a href="configuring.html#initializers">Initializers
section</a> of the Configuring guide, and works
precisely the same way as the <code>config/initializers</code> directory inside an
application. The same thing goes if you want to use a standard initializer.</p>
<p>For locales, simply place the locale files in the <code>config/locales</code> directory,
just like you would in an application.</p>
