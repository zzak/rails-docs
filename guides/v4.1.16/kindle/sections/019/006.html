<h3 id="database-pooling">7 Database pooling</h3>
<p>Active Record database connections are managed by <code>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool</code> which ensures that a connection pool synchronizes the amount of thread access to a limited number of database connections. This limit defaults to 5 and can be configured in <code>database.yml</code>.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

</pre>
</div>
<p>Since the connection pooling is handled inside of Active Record by default, all application servers (Thin, mongrel, Unicorn etc.) should behave the same. Initially, the database connection pool is empty and it will create additional connections as the demand for them increases, until it reaches the connection pool limit.</p>
<p>Any one request will check out a connection the first time it requires access to the database, after which it will check the connection back in, at the end of the request, meaning that the additional connection slot will be available again for the next request in the queue.</p>
<p>If you try to use more connections than are available, Active Record will block
and wait for a connection from the pool. When it cannot get connection, a timeout
error similar to given below will be thrown.</p>
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError - could not obtain a database connection within 5 seconds. The max pool size is currently 5; consider increasing it:

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you get the above error, you might want to increase the size of connection
pool by incrementing the <code>pool</code> option in <code>database.yml</code></p>
<div class="note"><p>As Rails is multi-threaded by default, there could be a chance that several threads may be accessing multiple connections simultaneously. So depending on your current request load, you could very well have multiple threads contending for a limited amount of connections.</p></div>
