<h3 id="reporting-an-issue">1 Reporting an Issue</h3>
<p>Ruby on Rails uses <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">GitHub Issue Tracking</a> to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found a bug in Ruby on Rails, this is the place to start. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull requests.</p>
<div class="note"><p>Bugs in the most recent released version of Ruby on Rails are likely to get the most attention. Also, the Rails core team is always interested in feedback from those who can take the time to test <em>edge Rails</em> (the code for the version of Rails that is currently under development). Later in this guide you'll find out how to get edge Rails for testing.</p></div>
<h4 id="creating-a-bug-report">1.1 Creating a Bug Report</h4>
<p>If you've found a problem in Ruby on Rails which is not a security risk, do a search in GitHub under <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">Issues</a> in case it was already reported. If you find no issue addressing it you can <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new">add a new one</a>. (See the next section for reporting security issues.)</p>
<p>At the minimum, your issue report needs a title and descriptive text. But that's only a minimum. You should include as much relevant information as possible. You need at least to post the code sample that has the issue. Even better is to include a unit test that shows how the expected behavior is not occurring. Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and figure out a fix.</p>
<p>Then, don't get your hopes up! Unless you have a "Code Red, Mission Critical, the World is Coming to an End" kind of bug, you're creating this issue report in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the issue report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating an issue like this is mostly to help yourself start on the path of fixing the problem and for others to confirm it with an "I'm having this problem too" comment.</p>
<h4 id="create-a-self-contained-gist-for-active-record-and-action-controller-issues">1.2 Create a Self-Contained gist for Active Record and Action Controller Issues</h4>
<p>If you are filing a bug report, please use
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_gem.rb">Active Record template for gems</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller_gem.rb">Action Controller template for gems</a>
if the bug is found in a published gem, and
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_master.rb">Active Record template for master</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller_master.rb">Action Controller template for master</a>
if the bug happens in the master branch.</p>
<h4 id="special-treatment-for-security-issues">1.3 Special Treatment for Security Issues</h4>
<div class="warning"><p>Please do not report security vulnerabilities with public GitHub issue reports. The <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/security">Rails security policy page</a> details the procedure to follow for security issues.</p></div>
<h4 id="what-about-feature-requests-questionmark">1.4 What about Feature Requests?</h4>
<p>Please don't put "feature request" items into GitHub Issues. If there's a new
feature that you want to see added to Ruby on Rails, you'll need to write the
code yourself - or convince someone else to partner with you to write the code.
Later in this guide you'll find detailed instructions for proposing a patch to
Ruby on Rails. If you enter a wishlist item in GitHub Issues with no code, you
can expect it to be marked "invalid" as soon as it's reviewed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the line between 'bug' and 'feature' is a hard one to draw.
Generally, a feature is anything that adds new behavior, while a bug is
anything that fixes already existing behavior that is misbehaving. Sometimes,
the core team will have to make a judgement call. That said, the distinction
generally just affects which release your patch will get in to; we love feature
submissions! They just won't get backported to maintenance branches.</p>
<p>If you'd like feedback on an idea for a feature before doing the work for make
a patch, please send an email to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core">rails-core mailing
list</a>. You
might get no response, which means that everyone is indifferent. You might find
someone who's also interested in building that feature. You might get a "This
won't be accepted." But it's the proper place to discuss new ideas. GitHub
Issues are not a particularly good venue for the sometimes long and involved
discussions new features require.</p>
