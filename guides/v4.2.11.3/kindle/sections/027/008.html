<h3 id="module-autoload-isn-t-involved">9 Module#autoload isn't Involved</h3>
<p><code>Module#autoload</code> provides a lazy way to load constants that is fully integrated
with the Ruby constant lookup algorithms, dynamic constant API, etc. It is quite
transparent.</p>

<p>Rails internals make extensive use of it to defer as much work as possible from
the boot process. But constant autoloading in Rails is <strong>not</strong> implemented with
<code>Module#autoload</code>.</p>

<p>One possible implementation based on <code>Module#autoload</code> would be to walk the
application tree and issue <code>autoload</code> calls that map existing file names to
their conventional constant name.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons that prevent Rails from using that implementation.</p>

<p>For example, <code>Module#autoload</code> is only capable of loading files using <code>require</code>,
so reloading would not be possible. Not only that, it uses an internal <code>require</code>
which is not <code>Kernel#require</code>.</p>

<p>Then, it provides no way to remove declarations in case a file is deleted. If a
constant gets removed with <code>Module#remove_const</code> its <code>autoload</code> is not triggered
again. Also, it doesn't support qualified names, so files with namespaces should
be interpreted during the walk tree to install their own <code>autoload</code> calls, but
those files could have constant references not yet configured.</p>

<p>An implementation based on <code>Module#autoload</code> would be awesome but, as you see,
at least as of today it is not possible. Constant autoloading in Rails is
implemented with <code>Module#const_missing</code>, and that's why it has its own contract,
documented in this guide.</p>
