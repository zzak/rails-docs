<h3 id="debugging-memory-leaks">4 Debugging Memory Leaks</h3>
<p>A Ruby application (on Rails or not), can leak memory - either in the Ruby code
or at the C code level.</p>

<p>In this section, you will learn how to find and fix such leaks by using tool
such as Valgrind.</p>

<h4 id="valgrind">4.1 Valgrind</h4>

<p><a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> is a Linux-only application for detecting
C-based memory leaks and race conditions.</p>

<p>There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management
and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. For example, if a C
extension in the interpreter calls <code>malloc()</code> but doesn't properly call
<code>free()</code>, this memory won't be available until the app terminates.</p>

<p>For further information on how to install Valgrind and use with Ruby, refer to
