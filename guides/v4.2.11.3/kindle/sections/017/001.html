<p>The main point is to ensure that all Rails apps will have a job infrastructure
in place, even if it's in the form of an "immediate runner". We can then have
framework features and other gems build on top of that, without having to
worry about API differences between various job runners such as Delayed Job
and Resque. Picking your queuing backend becomes more of an operational concern,
then. And you'll be able to switch between them without having to rewrite your jobs.</p>
