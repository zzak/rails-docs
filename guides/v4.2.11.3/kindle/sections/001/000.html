<h3 id="guide-assumptions">1 Guide Assumptions</h3>
<p>This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with a Rails
application from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience
with Rails. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some
prerequisites installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads">Ruby</a> language version 1.9.3 or newer.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a> packaging system, which is installed with Ruby
versions 1.9 and later. To learn more about RubyGems, please read the <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org">RubyGems Guides</a>.</li>
<li>A working installation of the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite3 Database</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language.
If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning
curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources
for learning Ruby:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/">Official Ruby Programming Language website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://resrc.io/list/10/list-of-free-programming-books/#ruby">reSRC's List of Free Programming Books</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover versions of Ruby as old as
1.6, and commonly 1.8, and will not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day
development with Rails.</p>
