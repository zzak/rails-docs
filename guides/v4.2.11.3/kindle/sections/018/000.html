<p>Rails makes it super easy to write your tests. It starts by producing skeleton test code while you are creating your models and controllers.</p>

<p>By simply running your Rails tests you can ensure your code adheres to the desired functionality even after some major code refactoring.</p>

<p>Rails tests can also simulate browser requests and thus you can test your application's response without having to test it through your browser.</p>
