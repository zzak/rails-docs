<h3 id="testing-an-engine">5 Testing an engine</h3>
<p>When an engine is generated, there is a smaller dummy application created inside
it at <code>test/dummy</code>. This application is used as a mounting point for the engine,
to make testing the engine extremely simple. You may extend this application by
generating controllers, models or views from within the directory, and then use
those to test your engine.</p>

<p>The <code>test</code> directory should be treated like a typical Rails testing environment,
allowing for unit, functional and integration tests.</p>

<h4 id="functional-tests">5.1 Functional Tests</h4>

<p>A matter worth taking into consideration when writing functional tests is that
the tests are going to be running on an application - the <code>test/dummy</code>
application - rather than your engine. This is due to the setup of the testing
environment; an engine needs an application as a host for testing its main
functionality, especially controllers. This means that if you were to make a
typical <code>GET</code> to a controller in a controller's functional test like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module Blorgh
  class FooControllerTest &lt; ActionController::TestCase
    def test_index
      get :index
      ...
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>It may not function correctly. This is because the application doesn't know how
to route these requests to the engine unless you explicitly tell it <strong>how</strong>. To
do this, you must set the <code>@routes</code> instance variable to the engine's route set
in your setup code:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module Blorgh
  class FooControllerTest &lt; ActionController::TestCase
    setup do
      @routes = Engine.routes
    end

    def test_index
      get :index
      ...
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This tells the application that you still want to perform a <code>GET</code> request to the
<code>index</code> action of this controller, but you want to use the engine's route to get
there, rather than the application's one.</p>

<p>This also ensures that the engine's URL helpers will work as expected in your
tests.</p>
