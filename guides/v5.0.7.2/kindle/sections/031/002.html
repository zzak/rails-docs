<h3 id="server-side-components">3 Server-Side Components</h3>
<h4 id="server-side-components-connections">3.1 Connections</h4>

<p><em>Connections</em> form the foundation of the client-server relationship. For every
WebSocket accepted by the server, a connection object is instantiated. This
object becomes the parent of all the <em>channel subscriptions</em> that are created
from there on. The connection itself does not deal with any specific application
logic beyond authentication and authorization. The client of a WebSocket
connection is called the connection <em>consumer</em>. An individual user will create
one consumer-connection pair per browser tab, window, or device they have open.</p>

<p>Connections are instances of <code>ApplicationCable::Connection</code>. In this class, you
authorize the incoming connection, and proceed to establish it if the user can
be identified.</p>

<h5 id="connection-setup">3.1.1 Connection Setup</h5>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/channels/application_cable/connection.rb
module ApplicationCable
  class Connection &lt; ActionCable::Connection::Base
    identified_by :current_user

    def connect
      self.current_user = find_verified_user
    end

    protected
      def find_verified_user
        if current_user = User.find_by(id: cookies.signed[:user_id])
          current_user
        else
          reject_unauthorized_connection
        end
      end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Here <code>identified_by</code> is a connection identifier that can be used to find the
specific connection later. Note that anything marked as an identifier will automatically
create a delegate by the same name on any channel instances created off the connection.</p>

<p>This example relies on the fact that you will already have handled authentication of the user
somewhere else in your application, and that a successful authentication sets a signed
cookie with the user ID.</p>

<p>The cookie is then automatically sent to the connection instance when a new connection
is attempted, and you use that to set the <code>current_user</code>. By identifying the connection
by this same current user, you're also ensuring that you can later retrieve all open
connections by a given user (and potentially disconnect them all if the user is deleted
or deauthorized).</p>

<h4 id="channels">3.2 Channels</h4>

<p>A <em>channel</em> encapsulates a logical unit of work, similar to what a controller does in a
regular MVC setup. By default, Rails creates a parent <code>ApplicationCable::Channel</code> class
for encapsulating shared logic between your channels.</p>

<h5 id="parent-channel-setup">3.2.1 Parent Channel Setup</h5>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/channels/application_cable/channel.rb
module ApplicationCable
  class Channel &lt; ActionCable::Channel::Base
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Then you would create your own channel classes. For example, you could have a
<code>ChatChannel</code> and an <code>AppearanceChannel</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/channels/chat_channel.rb
class ChatChannel &lt; ApplicationCable::Channel
end

# app/channels/appearance_channel.rb
class AppearanceChannel &lt; ApplicationCable::Channel
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>A consumer could then be subscribed to either or both of these channels.</p>

<h5 id="channels-subscriptions">3.2.2 Subscriptions</h5>

<p>Consumers subscribe to channels, acting as <em>subscribers</em>. Their connection is
called a <em>subscription</em>. Produced messages are then routed to these channel
subscriptions based on an identifier sent by the cable consumer.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
# app/channels/chat_channel.rb
class ChatChannel &lt; ApplicationCable::Channel
  # Called when the consumer has successfully
  # become a subscriber of this channel.
  def subscribed
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
</body>
</html>
