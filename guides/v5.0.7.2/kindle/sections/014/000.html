<h3 id="how-to-load-core-extensions">1 How to Load Core Extensions</h3>
<h4 id="stand-alone-active-support">1.1 Stand-Alone Active Support</h4>

<p>In order to have a near-zero default footprint, Active Support does not load anything by default. It is broken in small pieces so that you can load just what you need, and also has some convenience entry points to load related extensions in one shot, even everything.</p>

<p>Thus, after a simple require like:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'active_support'

</pre>
</div>
<p>objects do not even respond to <code>blank?</code>. Let's see how to load its definition.</p>

<h5 id="cherry-picking-a-definition">1.1.1 Cherry-picking a Definition</h5>

<p>The most lightweight way to get <code>blank?</code> is to cherry-pick the file that defines it.</p>

<p>For every single method defined as a core extension this guide has a note that says where such a method is defined. In the case of <code>blank?</code> the note reads:</p>

<div class="note"><p>Defined in <code>active_support/core_ext/object/blank.rb</code>.</p></div>

<p>That means that you can require it like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'active_support'
require 'active_support/core_ext/object/blank'

</pre>
</div>
<p>Active Support has been carefully revised so that cherry-picking a file loads only strictly needed dependencies, if any.</p>

<h5 id="loading-grouped-core-extensions">1.1.2 Loading Grouped Core Extensions</h5>

<p>The next level is to simply load all extensions to <code>Object</code>. As a rule of thumb, extensions to <code>SomeClass</code> are available in one shot by loading <code>active_support/core_ext/some_class</code>.</p>

<p>Thus, to load all extensions to <code>Object</code> (including <code>blank?</code>):</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'active_support'
require 'active_support/core_ext/object'

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="loading-all-core-extensions">1.1.3 Loading All Core Extensions</h5>

<p>You may prefer just to load all core extensions, there is a file for that:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'active_support'
require 'active_support/core_ext'

</pre>
</div>
<h5 id="loading-all-active-support">1.1.4 Loading All Active Support</h5>

<p>And finally, if you want to have all Active Support available just issue:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'active_support/all'

</pre>
</div>
<p>That does not even put the entire Active Support in memory upfront indeed, some stuff is configured via <code>autoload</code>, so it is only loaded if used.</p>

<h4 id="active-support-within-a-ruby-on-rails-application">1.2 Active Support Within a Ruby on Rails Application</h4>

<p>A Ruby on Rails application loads all Active Support unless <code>config.active_support.bare</code> is true. In that case, the application will only load what the framework itself cherry-picks for its own needs, and can still cherry-pick itself at any granularity level, as explained in the previous section.</p>
