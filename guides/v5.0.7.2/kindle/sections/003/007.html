<h3 id="migrations-and-seed-data">8 Migrations and Seed Data</h3>
<p>The main purpose of Rails' migration feature is to issue commands that modify the 
schema using a consistent process. Migrations can also be used 
to add or modify data. This is useful in an existing database that can't be destroyed 
and recreated, such as a production database. </p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class AddInitialProducts &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def up
    5.times do |i|
      Product.create(name: "Product ##{i}", description: "A product.")
    end
  end

  def down
    Product.delete_all
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>To add initial data after a database is created, Rails has a built-in 
'seeds' feature that makes the process quick and easy. This is especially 
useful when reloading the database frequently in development and test environments. 
It's easy to get started with this feature: just fill up <code>db/seeds.rb</code> with some 
Ruby code, and run <code>rails db:seed</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
5.times do |i|
  Product.create(name: "Product ##{i}", description: "A product.")
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This is generally a much cleaner way to set up the database of a blank
application.</p>
