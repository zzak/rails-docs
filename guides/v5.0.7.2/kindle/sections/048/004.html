<h3 id="action-controller">5 Action Controller</h3>
<p>Action Controller rolls out some significant changes to rendering, as well as improvements in routing and other areas, in this release.</p>

<h4 id="unified-rendering">5.1 Unified Rendering</h4>

<p><code>ActionController::Base#render</code> is a lot smarter about deciding what to render. Now you can just tell it what to render and expect to get the right results. In older versions of Rails, you often need to supply explicit information to render:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
render :file =&gt; '/tmp/random_file.erb'
render :template =&gt; 'other_controller/action'
render :action =&gt; 'show'

</pre>
</div>
<p>Now in Rails 2.3, you can just supply what you want to render:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
render '/tmp/random_file.erb'
render 'other_controller/action'
render 'show'
render :show

</pre>
</div>
<p>Rails chooses between file, template, and action depending on whether there is a leading slash, an embedded slash, or no slash at all in what's to be rendered. Note that you can also use a symbol instead of a string when rendering an action. Other rendering styles (<code>:inline</code>, <code>:text</code>, <code>:update</code>, <code>:nothing</code>, <code>:json</code>, <code>:xml</code>, <code>:js</code>) still require an explicit option.</p>

<h4 id="application-controller-renamed">5.2 Application Controller Renamed</h4>

<p>If you're one of the people who has always been bothered by the special-case naming of <code>application.rb</code>, rejoice! It's been reworked to be application_controller.rb in Rails 2.3. In addition, there's a new rake task, <code>rake rails:update:application_controller</code> to do this automatically for you - and it will be run as part of the normal <code>rake rails:update</code> process.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="http-digest-authentication-support">5.3 HTTP Digest Authentication Support</h4>

<p>Rails now has built-in support for HTTP digest authentication. To use it, you call <code>authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest</code> with a block that returns the user's password (which is then hashed and compared against the transmitted credentials):</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  Users = {"dhh" =&gt; "secret"}
  before_filter :authenticate

  def secret
    render :text =&gt; "Password Required!"
  end

  private
  def authenticate
    realm = "Application"
    authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest(realm) do |name|
      Users[name]
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</div>

</ul>
<h4 id="more-efficient-routing">5.4 More Efficient Routing</h4>

<p>There are a couple of significant routing changes in Rails 2.3. The <code>formatted_</code> route helpers are gone, in favor just passing in <code>:format</code> as an option. This cuts down the route generation process by 50% for any resource - and can save a substantial amount of memory (up to 100MB on large applications). If your code uses the <code>formatted_</code> helpers, it will still work for the time being - but that behavior is deprecated and your application will be more efficient if you rewrite those routes using the new standard. Another big change is that Rails now supports multiple routing files, not just <code>routes.rb</code>. You can use <code>RouteSet#add_configuration_file</code> to bring in more routes at any time - without clearing the currently-loaded routes. While this change is most useful for Engines, you can use it in any application that needs to load routes in batches.</p>

<h4 id="rack-based-lazy-loaded-sessions">5.5 Rack-based Lazy-loaded Sessions</h4>

<p>A big change pushed the underpinnings of Action Controller session storage down to the Rack level. This involved a good deal of work in the code, though it should be completely transparent to your Rails applications (as a bonus, some icky patches around the old CGI session handler got removed). It's still significant, though, for one simple reason: non-Rails Rack applications have access to the same session storage handlers (and therefore the same session) as your Rails applications. In addition, sessions are now lazy-loaded (in line with the loading improvements to the rest of the framework). This means that you no longer need to explicitly disable sessions if you don't want them; just don't refer to them and they won't load.</p>

<h4 id="mime-type-handling-changes">5.6 MIME Type Handling Changes</h4>

<p>There are a couple of changes to the code for handling MIME types in Rails. First, <code>MIME::Type</code> now implements the <code>=~</code> operator, making things much cleaner when you need to check for the presence of a type that has synonyms:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
if content_type &amp;&amp; Mime::JS =~ content_type
  # do something cool
end

Mime::JS =~ "text/javascript"        =&gt; true
Mime::JS =~ "application/javascript" =&gt; true

</pre>
</div>
<p>The other change is that the framework now uses the <code>Mime::JS</code> when checking for JavaScript in various spots, making it handle those alternatives cleanly.</p>

<h4 id="optimization-of-respond-to">5.7 Optimization of <code>respond_to</code>
</h4>

<p>In some of the first fruits of the Rails-Merb team merger, Rails 2.3 includes some optimizations for the <code>respond_to</code> method, which is of course heavily used in many Rails applications to allow your controller to format results differently based on the MIME type of the incoming request. After eliminating a call to <code>method_missing</code> and some profiling and tweaking, we're seeing an 8% improvement in the number of requests per second served with a simple <code>respond_to</code> that switches between three formats. The best part? No change at all required to the code of your application to take advantage of this speedup.</p>

<h4 id="improved-caching-performance">5.8 Improved Caching Performance</h4>

<p>Rails now keeps a per-request local cache of read from the remote cache stores, cutting down on unnecessary reads and leading to better site performance. While this work was originally limited to <code>MemCacheStore</code>, it is available to any remote store than implements the required methods.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="localized-views">5.9 Localized Views</h4>

<p>Rails can now provide localized views, depending on the locale that you have set. For example, suppose you have a <code>Posts</code> controller with a <code>show</code> action. By default, this will render <code>app/views/posts/show.html.erb</code>. But if you set <code>I18n.locale = :da</code>, it will render <code>app/views/posts/show.da.html.erb</code>. If the localized template isn't present, the undecorated version will be used. Rails also includes <code>I18n#available_locales</code> and <code>I18n::SimpleBackend#available_locales</code>, which return an array of the translations that are available in the current Rails project.</p>

<p>In addition, you can use the same scheme to localize the rescue files in the <code>public</code> directory: <code>public/500.da.html</code> or <code>public/404.en.html</code> work, for example.</p>

<h4 id="partial-scoping-for-translations">5.10 Partial Scoping for Translations</h4>

<p>A change to the translation API makes things easier and less repetitive to write key translations within partials. If you call <code>translate(".foo")</code> from the <code>people/index.html.erb</code> template, you'll actually be calling <code>I18n.translate("people.index.foo")</code> If you don't prepend the key with a period, then the API doesn't scope, just as before.</p>

<h4 id="other-action-controller-changes">5.11 Other Action Controller Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>ETag handling has been cleaned up a bit: Rails will now skip sending an ETag header when there's no body to the response or when sending files with <code>send_file</code>.</li>
<li>The fact that Rails checks for IP spoofing can be a nuisance for sites that do heavy traffic with cell phones, because their proxies don't generally set things up right. If that's you, you can now set <code>ActionController::Base.ip_spoofing_check = false</code> to disable the check entirely.</li>
<li>
<code>ActionController::Dispatcher</code> now implements its own middleware stack, which you can see by running <code>rake middleware</code>.</li>
<li>Cookie sessions now have persistent session identifiers, with API compatibility with the server-side stores.</li>
<li>You can now use symbols for the <code>:type</code> option of <code>send_file</code> and <code>send_data</code>, like this: <code>send_file("fabulous.png", :type =&gt; :png)</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>:only</code> and <code>:except</code> options for <code>map.resources</code> are no longer inherited by nested resources.</li>
<li>The bundled memcached client has been updated to version 1.6.4.99.</li>
<li>The <code>expires_in</code>, <code>stale?</code>, and <code>fresh_when</code> methods now accept a <code>:public</code> option to make them work well with proxy caching.</li>
<li>The <code>:requirements</code> option now works properly with additional RESTful member routes.</li>
<li>Shallow routes now properly respect namespaces.</li>
<li>
<code>polymorphic_url</code> does a better job of handling objects with irregular plural names.</li>
</ul>
