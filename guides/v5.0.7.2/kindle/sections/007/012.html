<h3 id="eager-loading-associations">13 Eager Loading Associations</h3>
<p>Eager loading is the mechanism for loading the associated records of the objects returned by <code>Model.find</code> using as few queries as possible.</p>

<p><strong>N + 1 queries problem</strong></p>

<p>Consider the following code, which finds 10 clients and prints their postcodes:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
clients = Client.limit(10)

clients.each do |client|
  puts client.address.postcode
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This code looks fine at the first sight. But the problem lies within the total number of queries executed. The above code executes 1 (to find 10 clients) + 10 (one per each client to load the address) = <strong>11</strong> queries in total.</p>

<p><strong>Solution to N + 1 queries problem</strong></p>

<p>Active Record lets you specify in advance all the associations that are going to be loaded. This is possible by specifying the <code>includes</code> method of the <code>Model.find</code> call. With <code>includes</code>, Active Record ensures that all of the specified associations are loaded using the minimum possible number of queries.</p>

<p>Revisiting the above case, we could rewrite <code>Client.limit(10)</code> to eager load addresses:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
clients = Client.includes(:address).limit(10)

clients.each do |client|
  puts client.address.postcode
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The above code will execute just <strong>2</strong> queries, as opposed to <strong>11</strong> queries in the previous case:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: sql; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
SELECT * FROM clients LIMIT 10
SELECT addresses.* FROM addresses
  WHERE (addresses.client_id IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10))

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="eager-loading-multiple-associations">13.1 Eager Loading Multiple Associations</h4>

<p>Active Record lets you eager load any number of associations with a single <code>Model.find</code> call by using an array, hash, or a nested hash of array/hash with the <code>includes</code> method.</p>

<h5 id="array-of-multiple-associations">13.1.1 Array of Multiple Associations</h5>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Article.includes(:category, :comments)

</pre>
</div>
<p>This loads all the articles and the associated category and comments for each article.</p>

<h5 id="nested-associations-hash">13.1.2 Nested Associations Hash</h5>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Category.includes(articles: [{ comments: :guest }, :tags]).find(1)

</pre>
</div>
<p>This will find the category with id 1 and eager load all of the associated articles, the associated articles' tags and comments, and every comment's guest association.</p>

<h4 id="specifying-conditions-on-eager-loaded-associations">13.2 Specifying Conditions on Eager Loaded Associations</h4>

<p>Even though Active Record lets you specify conditions on the eager loaded associations just like <code>joins</code>, the recommended way is to use <a href="#joining-tables">joins</a> instead.</p>

<p>However if you must do this, you may use <code>where</code> as you would normally.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Article.includes(:comments).where(comments: { visible: true })

</pre>
</div>
<p>This would generate a query which contains a <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> whereas the
<code>joins</code> method would generate one using the <code>INNER JOIN</code> function instead.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
  SELECT "articles"."id" AS t0_r0, ... "comments"."updated_at" AS t1_r5 FROM "articles" LEFT OUTER JOIN "comments" ON "comments"."article_id" = "articles"."id" WHERE (comments.visible = 1)

</pre>
</div>
<p>If there was no <code>where</code> condition, this would generate the normal set of two queries.</p>

<div class="note"><p>Using <code>where</code> like this will only work when you pass it a Hash. For
SQL-fragments you need to use <code>references</code> to force joined tables:</p></div>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Article.includes(:comments).where("comments.visible = true").references(:comments)

</pre>
</div>
<p>If, in the case of this <code>includes</code> query, there were no comments for any
articles, all the articles would still be loaded. By using <code>joins</code> (an INNER
JOIN), the join conditions <strong>must</strong> match, otherwise no records will be
returned.</p>
