<h3 id="request-forgery-protection">9 Request Forgery Protection</h3>
<p>Cross-site request forgery is a type of attack in which a site tricks a user into making requests on another site, possibly adding, modifying or deleting data on that site without the user's knowledge or permission.</p>

<p>The first step to avoid this is to make sure all "destructive" actions (create, update and destroy) can only be accessed with non-GET requests. If you're following RESTful conventions you're already doing this. However, a malicious site can still send a non-GET request to your site quite easily, and that's where the request forgery protection comes in. As the name says, it protects from forged requests.</p>

<p>The way this is done is to add a non-guessable token which is only known to your server to each request. This way, if a request comes in without the proper token, it will be denied access.</p>

<p>If you generate a form like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; html-script: true; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;%= form_for @user do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :username %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :password %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>You will see how the token gets added as a hidden field:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: xml; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/users/1" method="post"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden"
       value="67250ab105eb5ad10851c00a5621854a23af5489"
       name="authenticity_token"/&gt;
&lt;!-- fields --&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Rails adds this token to every form that's generated using the <a href="form_helpers.html">form helpers</a>, so most of the time you don't have to worry about it. If you're writing a form manually or need to add the token for another reason, it's available through the method <code>form_authenticity_token</code>:</p>

<p>The <code>form_authenticity_token</code> generates a valid authentication token. That's useful in places where Rails does not add it automatically, like in custom Ajax calls.</p>

<p>The <a href="security.html">Security Guide</a> has more about this and a lot of other security-related issues that you should be aware of when developing a web application.</p>
