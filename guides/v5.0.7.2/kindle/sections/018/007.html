<h3 id="testing-views">8 Testing Views</h3>
<p>Testing the response to your request by asserting the presence of key HTML elements and their content is a common way to test the views of your application. Like route tests, view tests reside in <code>test/controllers/</code> or are part of controller tests. The <code>assert_select</code> method allows you to query HTML elements of the response by using a simple yet powerful syntax.</p>

<p>There are two forms of <code>assert_select</code>:</p>

<p><code>assert_select(selector, [equality], [message])</code> ensures that the equality condition is met on the selected elements through the selector. The selector may be a CSS selector expression (String) or an expression with substitution values.</p>

<p><code>assert_select(element, selector, [equality], [message])</code> ensures that the equality condition is met on all the selected elements through the selector starting from the <em>element</em> (instance of <code>Nokogiri::XML::Node</code> or <code>Nokogiri::XML::NodeSet</code>) and its descendants.</p>

<p>For example, you could verify the contents on the title element in your response with:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
assert_select 'title', "Welcome to Rails Testing Guide"

</pre>
</div>
<p>You can also use nested <code>assert_select</code> blocks for deeper investigation.</p>

<p>In the following example, the inner <code>assert_select</code> for <code>li.menu_item</code> runs
within the collection of elements selected by the outer block:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
assert_select 'ul.navigation' do
  assert_select 'li.menu_item'
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>A collection of selected elements may be iterated through so that <code>assert_select</code> may be called separately for each element.</p>

<p>For example if the response contains two ordered lists, each with four nested list elements then the following tests will both pass.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
assert_select "ol" do |elements|
  elements.each do |element|
    assert_select element, "li", 4
  end
end

assert_select "ol" do
  assert_select "li", 8
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This assertion is quite powerful. For more advanced usage, refer to its <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-dom-testing/blob/master/lib/rails/dom/testing/assertions/selector_assertions.rb">documentation</a>.</p>

<h5 id="additional-view-based-assertions">8.1 Additional View-Based Assertions</h5>

<p>There are more assertions that are primarily used in testing views:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Assertion</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>assert_select_email</code></td>
<td>Allows you to make assertions on the body of an e-mail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>assert_select_encoded</code></td>
<td>Allows you to make assertions on encoded HTML. It does this by un-encoding the contents of each element and then calling the block with all the un-encoded elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>css_select(selector)</code> or <code>css_select(element, selector)</code>
</td>
<td>Returns an array of all the elements selected by the <em>selector</em>. In the second variant it first matches the base <em>element</em> and tries to match the <em>selector</em> expression on any of its children. If there are no matches both variants return an empty array.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here's an example of using <code>assert_select_email</code>:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
assert_select_email do
  assert_select 'small', 'Please click the "Unsubscribe" link if you want to opt-out.'
end

</pre>
</div>
</body>
</html>
