<h3 id="constants-refresher">2 Constants Refresher</h3>
<p>While constants are trivial in most programming languages, they are a rich
topic in Ruby.</p>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this guide to document Ruby constants, but we are
nevertheless going to highlight a few key topics. Truly grasping the following
sections is instrumental to understanding constant autoloading and reloading.</p>

<h4 id="nesting">2.1 Nesting</h4>

<p>Class and module definitions can be nested to create namespaces:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module XML
  class SAXParser
    # (1)
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The <em>nesting</em> at any given place is the collection of enclosing nested class and
module objects outwards. The nesting at any given place can be inspected with
<code>Module.nesting</code>. For example, in the previous example, the nesting at
(1) is</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
[XML::SAXParser, XML]

</pre>
</div>
<p>It is important to understand that the nesting is composed of class and module
<em>objects</em>, it has nothing to do with the constants used to access them, and is
also unrelated to their names.</p>

<p>For instance, while this definition is similar to the previous one:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class XML::SAXParser
  # (2)
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>the nesting in (2) is different:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
[XML::SAXParser]

</pre>
</div>
<p><code>XML</code> does not belong to it.</p>

<p>We can see in this example that the name of a class or module that belongs to a
certain nesting does not necessarily correlate with the namespaces at the spot.</p>

<p>Even more, they are totally independent, take for instance</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module X
  module Y
  end
end

module A
  module B
  end
end

module X::Y
  module A::B
    # (3)
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The nesting in (3) consists of two module objects:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
[A::B, X::Y]

</pre>
</div>
<p>So, it not only doesn't end in <code>A</code>, which does not even belong to the nesting,
but it also contains <code>X::Y</code>, which is independent from <code>A::B</code>.</p>

<p>The nesting is an internal stack maintained by the interpreter, and it gets
modified according to these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The class object following a <code>class</code> keyword gets pushed when its body is
executed, and popped after it.</li>
<li>The module object following a <code>module</code> keyword gets pushed when its body is
executed, and popped after it.</li>
<li>A singleton class opened with <code>class &lt;&lt; object</code> gets pushed, and popped later.</li>
<li>When <code>instance_eval</code> is called using a string argument,
the singleton class of the receiver is pushed to the nesting of the eval'ed
code. When <code>class_eval</code> or <code>module_eval</code> is called using a string argument,
the receiver is pushed to the nesting of the eval'ed code.</li>
<li>The nesting at the top-level of code interpreted by <code>Kernel#load</code> is empty
unless the <code>load</code> call receives a true value as second argument, in which case
a newly created anonymous module is pushed by Ruby.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to observe that blocks do not modify the stack. In particular
the blocks that may be passed to <code>Class.new</code> and <code>Module.new</code> do not get the
class or module being defined pushed to their nesting. That's one of the
differences between defining classes and modules in one way or another.</p>

<h4 id="class-and-module-definitions-are-constant-assignments">2.2 Class and Module Definitions are Constant Assignments</h4>

<p>Let's suppose the following snippet creates a class (rather than reopening it):</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class C
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Ruby creates a constant <code>C</code> in <code>Object</code> and stores in that constant a class
object. The name of the class instance is "C", a string, named after the
constant.</p>

<p>That is,</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Project &lt; ApplicationRecord
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>performs a constant assignment equivalent to</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Project = Class.new(ApplicationRecord)

</pre>
</div>
<p>including setting the name of the class as a side-effect:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Project.name # =&gt; "Project"

</pre>
</div>
<p>Constant assignment has a special rule to make that happen: if the object
being assigned is an anonymous class or module, Ruby sets the object's name to
the name of the constant.</p>

<div class="info"><p>From then on, what happens to the constant and the instance does not
matter. For example, the constant could be deleted, the class object could be
assigned to a different constant, be stored in no constant anymore, etc. Once
the name is set, it doesn't change.</p></div>

<p>Similarly, module creation using the <code>module</code> keyword as in</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module Admin
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>performs a constant assignment equivalent to</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Admin = Module.new

</pre>
</div>
<p>including setting the name as a side-effect:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Admin.name # =&gt; "Admin"

</pre>
</div>
<div class="warning"><p>The execution context of a block passed to <code>Class.new</code> or <code>Module.new</code>
is not entirely equivalent to the one of the body of the definitions using the
<code>class</code> and <code>module</code> keywords. But both idioms result in the same constant
assignment.</p></div>

<p>Thus, when one informally says "the <code>String</code> class", that really means: the
class object stored in the constant called "String" in the class object stored
in the <code>Object</code> constant. <code>String</code> is otherwise an ordinary Ruby constant and
everything related to constants such as resolution algorithms applies to it.</p>

<p>Likewise, in the controller</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p><code>Post</code> is not syntax for a class. Rather, <code>Post</code> is a regular Ruby constant. If
all is good, the constant is evaluated to an object that responds to <code>all</code>.</p>

<p>That is why we talk about <em>constant</em> autoloading, Rails has the ability to
load constants on the fly.</p>

<h4 id="constants-are-stored-in-modules">2.3 Constants are Stored in Modules</h4>

<p>Constants belong to modules in a very literal sense. Classes and modules have
a constant table; think of it as a hash table.</p>

<p>Let's analyze an example to really understand what that means. While common
abuses of language like "the <code>String</code> class" are convenient, the exposition is
going to be precise here for didactic purposes.</p>

<p>Let's consider the following module definition:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
module Colors
  RED = '0xff0000'
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>First, when the <code>module</code> keyword is processed, the interpreter creates a new
entry in the constant table of the class object stored in the <code>Object</code> constant.
Said entry associates the name "Colors" to a newly created module object.
Furthermore, the interpreter sets the name of the new module object to be the
string "Colors".</p>

<p>Later, when the body of the module definition is interpreted, a new entry is
created in the constant table of the module object stored in the <code>Colors</code>
constant. That entry maps the name "RED" to the string "0xff0000".</p>

<p>In particular, <code>Colors::RED</code> is totally unrelated to any other <code>RED</code> constant
that may live in any other class or module object. If there were any, they
would have separate entries in their respective constant tables.</p>

<p>Pay special attention in the previous paragraphs to the distinction between
class and module objects, constant names, and value objects associated to them
in constant tables.</p>

<h4 id="resolution-algorithms">2.4 Resolution Algorithms</h4>

<h5 id="resolution-algorithm-for-relative-constants">2.4.1 Resolution Algorithm for Relative Constants</h5>

<p>At any given place in the code, let's define <em>cref</em> to be the first element of
the nesting if it is not empty, or <code>Object</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Without getting too much into the details, the resolution algorithm for relative
constant references goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the nesting is not empty the constant is looked up in its elements and in
order. The ancestors of those elements are ignored.</li>
<li>If not found, then the algorithm walks up the ancestor chain of the cref.</li>
<li>If not found and the cref is a module, the constant is looked up in <code>Object</code>.</li>
<li>If not found, <code>const_missing</code> is invoked on the cref. The default
implementation of <code>const_missing</code> raises <code>NameError</code>, but it can be overridden.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rails autoloading <strong>does not emulate this algorithm</strong>, but its starting point is
the name of the constant to be autoloaded, and the cref. See more in <a href="#autoloading-algorithms-relative-references">Relative
References</a>.</p>

<h5 id="resolution-algorithm-for-qualified-constants">2.4.2 Resolution Algorithm for Qualified Constants</h5>

<p>Qualified constants look like this:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
Billing::Invoice

</pre>
</div>
<p><code>Billing::Invoice</code> is composed of two constants: <code>Billing</code> is relative and is
resolved using the algorithm of the previous section.</p>

<div class="info"><p>Leading colons would make the first segment absolute rather than
relative: <code>::Billing::Invoice</code>. That would force <code>Billing</code> to be looked up
only as a top-level constant.</p></div>

<p><code>Invoice</code> on the other hand is qualified by <code>Billing</code> and we are going to see
its resolution next. Let's define <em>parent</em> to be that qualifying class or module
object, that is, <code>Billing</code> in the example above. The algorithm for qualified
constants goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The constant is looked up in the parent and its ancestors.</li>
<li>If the lookup fails, <code>const_missing</code> is invoked in the parent. The default
implementation of <code>const_missing</code> raises <code>NameError</code>, but it can be overridden.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, this algorithm is simpler than the one for relative constants. In
particular, the nesting plays no role here, and modules are not special-cased,
if neither they nor their ancestors have the constants, <code>Object</code> is <strong>not</strong>
checked.</p>

<p>Rails autoloading <strong>does not emulate this algorithm</strong>, but its starting point is
the name of the constant to be autoloaded, and the parent. See more in
<a href="#autoloading-algorithms-qualified-references">Qualified References</a>.</p>
