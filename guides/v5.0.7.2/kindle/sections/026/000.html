<p>Ruby on Rails allows applications to be written as if their code was preloaded.</p>

<p>In a normal Ruby program classes need to load their dependencies:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
require 'application_controller'
require 'post'

class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>Our Rubyist instinct quickly sees some redundancy in there: If classes were
defined in files matching their name, couldn't their loading be automated
somehow? We could save scanning the file for dependencies, which is brittle.</p>

<p>Moreover, <code>Kernel#require</code> loads files once, but development is much more smooth
if code gets refreshed when it changes without restarting the server. It would
be nice to be able to use <code>Kernel#load</code> in development, and <code>Kernel#require</code> in
production.</p>

<p>Indeed, those features are provided by Ruby on Rails, where we just write</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>This guide documents how that works.</p>
