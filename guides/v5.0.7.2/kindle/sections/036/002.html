<h3 id="contributing-to-the-rails-documentation">3 Contributing to the Rails Documentation</h3>
<p>Ruby on Rails has two main sets of documentation: the guides, which help you
learn about Ruby on Rails, and the API, which serves as a reference.</p>

<p>You can help improve the Rails guides by making them more coherent, consistent or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest edge Rails.</p>

<p>You can either open a pull request to <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails">Rails</a> or
ask the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">Rails core team</a> for commit access on
docrails if you contribute regularly.
Please do not open pull requests in docrails, if you'd like to get feedback on your
change, ask for it in <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails">Rails</a> instead.</p>

<p>Docrails is merged with master regularly, so you are effectively editing the Ruby on Rails documentation.</p>

<p>If you are unsure of the documentation changes, you can create an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">Rails</a> issues tracker on GitHub.</p>

<p>When working with documentation, please take into account the <a href="api_documentation_guidelines.html">API Documentation Guidelines</a> and the <a href="ruby_on_rails_guides_guidelines.html">Ruby on Rails Guides Guidelines</a>.</p>

<div class="note"><p>As explained earlier, ordinary code patches should have proper documentation coverage. Docrails is only used for isolated documentation improvements.</p></div>

<div class="note"><p>To help our CI servers you should add [ci skip] to your documentation commit message to skip build on that commit. Please remember to use it for commits containing only documentation changes.</p></div>

<div class="warning"><p>Docrails has a very strict policy: no code can be touched whatsoever, no matter how trivial or small the change. Only RDoc and guides can be edited via docrails. Also, CHANGELOGs should never be edited in docrails.</p></div>
