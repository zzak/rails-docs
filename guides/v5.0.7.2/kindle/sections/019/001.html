<h3 id="sessions">2 Sessions</h3>
<p>A good place to start looking at security is with sessions, which can be vulnerable to particular attacks.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-sessions-questionmark">2.1 What are Sessions?</h4>

<div class="note"><p><em>HTTP is a stateless protocol. Sessions make it stateful.</em></p></div>

<p>Most applications need to keep track of certain state of a particular user. This could be the contents of a shopping basket or the user id of the currently logged in user. Without the idea of sessions, the user would have to identify, and probably authenticate, on every request.
Rails will create a new session automatically if a new user accesses the application. It will load an existing session if the user has already used the application.</p>

<p>A session usually consists of a hash of values and a session id, usually a 32-character string, to identify the hash. Every cookie sent to the client's browser includes the session id. And the other way round: the browser will send it to the server on every request from the client. In Rails you can save and retrieve values using the session method:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
session[:user_id] = @current_user.id
User.find(session[:user_id])

</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="session-id">2.2 Session id</h4>

<div class="note"><p><em>The session id is a 32 byte long MD5 hash value.</em></p></div>

<p>A session id consists of the hash value of a random string. The random string is the current time, a random number between 0 and 1, the process id number of the Ruby interpreter (also basically a random number) and a constant string. Currently it is not feasible to brute-force Rails' session ids. To date MD5 is uncompromised, but there have been collisions, so it is theoretically possible to create another input text with the same hash value. But this has had no security impact to date.</p>

<h4 id="session-hijacking">2.3 Session Hijacking</h4>

<div class="warning"><p><em>Stealing a user's session id lets an attacker use the web application in the victim's name.</em></p></div>

<p>Many web applications have an authentication system: a user provides a user name and password, the web application checks them and stores the corresponding user id in the session hash. From now on, the session is valid. On every request the application will load the user, identified by the user id in the session, without the need for new authentication. The session id in the cookie identifies the session.</p>

<p>Hence, the cookie serves as temporary authentication for the web application. Anyone who seizes a cookie from someone else, may use the web application as this user - with possibly severe consequences. Here are some ways to hijack a session, and their countermeasures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sniff the cookie in an insecure network. A wireless LAN can be an example of such a network. In an unencrypted wireless LAN, it is especially easy to listen to the traffic of all connected clients. For the web application builder this means to <em>provide a secure connection over SSL</em>. In Rails 3.1 and later, this could be accomplished by always forcing SSL connection in your application config file:
<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
config.force_ssl = true

</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Most people don't clear out the cookies after working at a public terminal. So if the last user didn't log out of a web application, you would be able to use it as this user. Provide the user with a <em>log-out button</em> in the web application, and <em>make it prominent</em>.</li>
<li>Many cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits aim at obtaining the user's cookie. You'll read <a href="#cross-site-scripting-xss">more about XSS</a> later.</li>
<li>Instead of stealing a cookie unknown to the attacker, they fix a user's session identifier (in the cookie) known to them. Read more about this so-called session fixation later.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main objective of most attackers is to make money. The underground prices for stolen bank login accounts range from $10-$1000 (depending on the available amount of funds), $0.40-$20 for credit card numbers, $1-$8 for online auction site accounts and $4-$30 for email passwords, according to the <a href="http://eval.symantec.com/mktginfo/enterprise/white_papers/b-whitepaper_internet_security_threat_report_xiii_04-2008.en-us.pdf">Symantec Global Internet Security Threat Report</a>.</p>

<h4 id="session-guidelines">2.4 Session Guidelines</h4>

<p>Here are some general guidelines on sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Do not store large objects in a session</em>. Instead you should store them in the database and save their id in the session. This will eliminate synchronization headaches and it won't fill up your session storage space (depending on what session storage you chose, see below).
This will also be a good idea, if you modify the structure of an object and old versions of it are still in some user's cookies. With server-side session storages you can clear out the sessions, but with client-side storages, this is hard to mitigate.</li>
<li>
<em>Critical data should not be stored in session</em>. If the user clears their cookies or closes the browser, they will be lost. And with a client-side session storage, the user can read the data.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="session-storage">2.5 Session Storage</h4>

<div class="note"><p><em>Rails provides several storage mechanisms for the session hashes. The most important is <code>ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore</code>.</em></p></div>

<p>Rails 2 introduced a new default session storage, CookieStore. CookieStore saves the session hash directly in a cookie on the client-side. The server retrieves the session hash from the cookie and eliminates the need for a session id. That will greatly increase the speed of the application, but it is a controversial storage option and you have to think about the security implications of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies imply a strict size limit of 4kB. This is fine as you should not store large amounts of data in a session anyway, as described before. <em>Storing the current user's database id in a session is usually ok</em>.</li>
<li>The client can see everything you store in a session, because it is stored in clear-text (actually Base64-encoded, so not encrypted). So, of course, <em>you don't want to store any secrets here</em>. To prevent session hash tampering, a digest is calculated from the session with a server-side secret (<code>secrets.secret_token</code>) and inserted into the end of the cookie.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, since Rails 4, the default store is EncryptedCookieStore. With
EncryptedCookieStore the session is encrypted before being stored in a cookie.
This prevents the user from accessing and tampering the content of the cookie.
Thus the session becomes a more secure place to store data. The encryption is
done using a server-side secret key <code>secrets.secret_key_base</code> stored in
<code>config/secrets.yml</code>.</p>

<p>That means the security of this storage depends on this secret (and on the digest algorithm, which defaults to SHA1, for compatibility). So <em>don't use a trivial secret, i.e. a word from a dictionary, or one which is shorter than 30 characters, use <code>rails secret</code> instead</em>.</p>

<p><code>secrets.secret_key_base</code> is used for specifying a key which allows sessions for the application to be verified against a known secure key to prevent tampering. Applications get <code>secrets.secret_key_base</code> initialized to a random key present in <code>config/secrets.yml</code>, e.g.:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
development:
  secret_key_base: a75d...

test:
  secret_key_base: 492f...

production:
  secret_key_base: &lt;%= ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] %&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<p>Older versions of Rails use CookieStore, which uses <code>secret_token</code> instead of <code>secret_key_base</code> that is used by EncryptedCookieStore. Read the upgrade documentation for more information.</p>

<p>If you have received an application where the secret was exposed (e.g. an application whose source was shared), strongly consider changing the secret.</p>

<h4 id="replay-attacks-for-cookiestore-sessions">2.6 Replay Attacks for CookieStore Sessions</h4>

<div class="info"><p><em>Another sort of attack you have to be aware of when using <code>CookieStore</code> is the replay attack.</em></p></div>

<p>It works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user receives credits, the amount is stored in a session (which is a bad idea anyway, but we'll do this for demonstration purposes).</li>
<li>The user buys something.</li>
<li>The new adjusted credit value is stored in the session.</li>
<li>The user takes the cookie from the first step (which they previously copied) and replaces the current cookie in the browser.</li>
<li>The user has their original credit back.</li>
</ul>
<p>Including a nonce (a random value) in the session solves replay attacks. A nonce is valid only once, and the server has to keep track of all the valid nonces. It gets even more complicated if you have several application servers (mongrels). Storing nonces in a database table would defeat the entire purpose of CookieStore (avoiding accessing the database).</p>

<p>The best <em>solution against it is not to store this kind of data in a session, but in the database</em>. In this case store the credit in the database and the logged_in_user_id in the session.</p>

<h4 id="session-fixation">2.7 Session Fixation</h4>

<div class="note"><p><em>Apart from stealing a user's session id, the attacker may fix a session id known to them. This is called session fixation.</em></p></div>

<p><img src="/home/rails/v5.0.7.2/guides/output/kindle/images/session_fixation.png" alt="Session fixation"></p>

<p>This attack focuses on fixing a user's session id known to the attacker, and forcing the user's browser into using this id. It is therefore not necessary for the attacker to steal the session id afterwards. Here is how this attack works:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker creates a valid session id: They load the login page of the web application where they want to fix the session, and take the session id in the cookie from the response (see number 1 and 2 in the image).</li>
<li>They maintain the session by accessing the web application periodically in order to keep an expiring session alive.</li>
<li>The attacker forces the user's browser into using this session id (see number 3 in the image). As you may not change a cookie of another domain (because of the same origin policy), the attacker has to run a JavaScript from the domain of the target web application. Injecting the JavaScript code into the application by XSS accomplishes this attack. Here is an example: <code>&lt;script&gt;document.cookie="_session_id=16d5b78abb28e3d6206b60f22a03c8d9";&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Read more about XSS and injection later on.</li>
<li>The attacker lures the victim to the infected page with the JavaScript code. By viewing the page, the victim's browser will change the session id to the trap session id.</li>
<li>As the new trap session is unused, the web application will require the user to authenticate.</li>
<li>From now on, the victim and the attacker will co-use the web application with the same session: The session became valid and the victim didn't notice the attack.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="session-fixation-countermeasures">2.8 Session Fixation - Countermeasures</h4>

<div class="info"><p><em>One line of code will protect you from session fixation.</em></p></div>

<p>The most effective countermeasure is to <em>issue a new session identifier</em> and declare the old one invalid after a successful login. That way, an attacker cannot use the fixed session identifier. This is a good countermeasure against session hijacking, as well. Here is how to create a new session in Rails:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
reset_session

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you use the popular <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/devise">Devise</a> gem for user management, it will automatically expire sessions on sign in and sign out for you. If you roll your own, remember to expire the session after your sign in action (when the session is created). This will remove values from the session, therefore <em>you will have to transfer them to the new session</em>.</p>

<p>Another countermeasure is to <em>save user-specific properties in the session</em>, verify them every time a request comes in, and deny access, if the information does not match. Such properties could be the remote IP address or the user agent (the web browser name), though the latter is less user-specific. When saving the IP address, you have to bear in mind that there are Internet service providers or large organizations that put their users behind proxies. <em>These might change over the course of a session</em>, so these users will not be able to use your application, or only in a limited way.</p>

<h4 id="session-expiry">2.9 Session Expiry</h4>

<div class="note"><p><em>Sessions that never expire extend the time-frame for attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), session hijacking and session fixation.</em></p></div>

<p>One possibility is to set the expiry time-stamp of the cookie with the session id. However the client can edit cookies that are stored in the web browser so expiring sessions on the server is safer. Here is an example of how to <em>expire sessions in a database table</em>. Call <code>Session.sweep("20 minutes")</code> to expire sessions that were used longer than 20 minutes ago.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
class Session &lt; ApplicationRecord
  def self.sweep(time = 1.hour)
    if time.is_a?(String)
      time = time.split.inject { |count, unit| count.to_i.send(unit) }
    end

    delete_all "updated_at &lt; '#{time.ago.to_s(:db)}'"
  end
end

</pre>
</div>
<p>The section about session fixation introduced the problem of maintained sessions. An attacker maintaining a session every five minutes can keep the session alive forever, although you are expiring sessions. A simple solution for this would be to add a created_at column to the sessions table. Now you can delete sessions that were created a long time ago. Use this line in the sweep method above:</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
delete_all "updated_at &lt; '#{time.ago.to_s(:db)}' OR
  created_at &lt; '#{2.days.ago.to_s(:db)}'"

</pre>
</div>
