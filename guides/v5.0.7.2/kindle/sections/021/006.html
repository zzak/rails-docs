<h3 id="database-pooling">7 Database pooling</h3>
<p>Active Record database connections are managed by <code>ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionPool</code> which ensures that a connection pool synchronizes the amount of thread access to a limited number of database connections. This limit defaults to 5 and can be configured in <code>database.yml</code>.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

</pre>
</div>
<p>Since the connection pooling is handled inside of Active Record by default, all application servers (Thin, mongrel, Unicorn etc.) should behave the same. The database connection pool is initially empty. As demand for connections increases it will create them until it reaches the connection pool limit.</p>

<p>Any one request will check out a connection the first time it requires access to the database. At the end of the request it will check the connection back in. This means that the additional connection slot will be available again for the next request in the queue.</p>

<p>If you try to use more connections than are available, Active Record will block
you and wait for a connection from the pool. If it cannot get a connection, a
timeout error similar to that given below will be thrown.</p>

<div class="code_container">
<pre class="brush: ruby; gutter: false; toolbar: false">
ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError - could not obtain a database connection within 5.000 seconds (waited 5.000 seconds)

</pre>
</div>
<p>If you get the above error, you might want to increase the size of the
connection pool by incrementing the <code>pool</code> option in <code>database.yml</code></p>

<div class="note"><p>If you are running in a multi-threaded environment, there could be a chance that several threads may be accessing multiple connections simultaneously. So depending on your current request load, you could very well have multiple threads contending for a limited number of connections.</p></div>
